No matter what I did, I was continuously feeling like I’d never be able to balance the two without having to sacrifice one for the other. I began to realize that the elusive “work and life balance” didn’t exist. It was exhausting and both my business and life suffered.  What I craved was a way of living and working in a symbiotic rhythm.

Work and life integration became the most important part of maintaining sanity in the midst of everything that mattered the most to me. Today, it’s through integration that I can continue to hustle with heart as best I can. Here are some pointers on integrating your work and life:

#### **Prioritize A** **_Simple_** **Self-Care Routine**

When we think about self-care, our minds automatically think of trips to the day spa. But self-care needs to done daily. _The key to sticking to a self-care routine is adopting 1-3 actions that you could do daily._

It can be as simple as starting the day having coffee out on the porch and a morning prayer of gratitude. Perhaps an afternoon meditation, followed by journaling is more your style. For others, taking a walk around the block and, dare I say, scheduling a power nap after lunch is what will keep you energized.  The saying goes, _“You can’t pour from an empty cup. Take care of yourself first.”_ The point of self-care, then, is to make sure you are continuously filled, so you can do the work you oh-so-love and be of the best service to others.[![valeriedenisephotos-48](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-48.jpg)](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-48.jpg)

**Honor All Of You**

The reality is you are not only an entrepreneur with a purpose and an important message. You are also a wife with a promise of love and unwavering support. You are a mother with dreams of endless laughter and happiness for your children. You are a friend with the perfect shoulder to cry on.

The list of the many parts that make up your whole doesn’t stop there. _The pressure to be everything to everyone can become the reason that you can’t be any to anybody._ So honor every single part of you, intentionally and wholeheartedly.

Take time to be a partner whose attention is undivided. Give yourself grace to spend the day in bed with your sick child. Make it a point to unapologetically have some fun with your besties. When it’s time to serve within your business, do so with love as you would any other part of your whole.

#### **Allow Room For Life Collaboration To Happen**

“Collaboration over competition” has seemed to become a common mantra in today’s entrepreneurial world, but it needs to be a life mantra. Women possess an inherent want to do everything and be the best at everything they do. With a bit of humility, you can begin to accept your limitations and accept some good ‘ol life collaboration with others.

There’ll be project launches that will need your utmost attention. During these times, ask your roomie or partner to pick up dinner. Perhaps you can swap babysitting duties with a close friend to allow her to have a day to herself and vice versa.   

Like business collabs, the key to good life collaborations is having relationships where each person brings something special to the table. Together, you can help each other to flourish and, ultimately, allow you to rock your business.[![valeriedenisephotos-44](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-44.jpg)](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-44.jpg)**Create Space For Intentional Relationships**

The relationships you have within your life will almost certainly dictate the way you show up in your business. Surrounding yourself with individuals that support and challenge you is important when working towards your business goals. Be intentional with the relationships that you build. Make sure they enhance your life, not drag you down. Create space in your life to nurture the kinds of relationships that are built upon mutual respect and admiration for one another.

#### **Embrace The Authentic You**

In a society where businesses can mirror the next, there’s extreme power in running your business your way. What separates you from the competition will always be your own flavor, so embrace your strengths, as well as your quirks. It’s your personality and creativity that will set you apart from others. No one can do you better than you.

Get comfortable with who you are, what you believe in, and the why behind your passion. Gone are the days of being one person in front of one crowd and, then being another in a different setting. _You are your brand._ So let the world know who you are and what you represent. Always speak from the heart and conduct yourself in a way that feels good for you. Be you all the time.

You don’t have to sacrifice life for business or vice versa. You’re allowed to hustle with heart and love hard at the same time. Fold your business into your life. Incorporate your life priorities with your passion work. Know what feels right for you and surrender to the flow. You and your sanity will thank you.
