The time has come ladies. We've mentioned it here and there, and now it's finally happening. Our Kickstarter Campaign is launching at the beginning of April! We're lining up some great perks for you, working on finishing up our video, and planning an international Launch party to celebrate!

Yes, we will be having multiple parties all over the country + one in Canada! (Thanks [Jacklyn Denise Co.](http://www.jacklyndenise.com/) in Toronto for making us international!) We would love for you to attend, meet new like-minded women in your area, view our Kickstarter + a special message from the Yellow Team.
