As you may have heard, [The Yellow Collective membership](http://yellowcollective.com/) is open until Friday of this week! If you want to get in on next quarter, make sure to [hop on](http://yellowcollective.co/) before we close up!

We currently have 16 Collective chapters across the country, meeting monthly (see current chapters in the image above). The women leading these chapters have a desire to come together and make this world a better place. They each have their own causes they're passionate about while they pour into and connect with our members every month, encouraging and inspiring them to lean into what they too, care about in this world.

It's a powerful thing, to hear what stirs deeply in the heart of another. What they care about, what makes them get up every morning, and what they're fighting for. It's a powerful thing to articulate and to speak into existence.

I'm always amazed by the hard work that our community is doing in making the world a better place.

To help you get to know our leaders a bit better, I asked them on our Facebook group to tell me what they're currently passionate about.

Here are a few things they said:

_**"Right now I'm passionate about foster care -- There are 35,000 kids in the system in LA county and there's such a need for empathetic, engaged allies to come along side these kids and their families through foster care, Court Appointed Special Advocates and mentoring, and I'm hoping that I can be an ally and friend to some of these families in the near future ." **_

~ Meg Long, LA Valley Chapter Leader

_**"Right now, with so much going on here I find myself super passionate about advocating for marginalized populations and helping bridge the gaps in education, opportunities, and resources that result from a widening socio-economic divide. I've had a few conversations lately about accessibility and not leaving groups of people behind as we move forward."**_

~ Rachael Parker-Chavez, West LA Chapter Leader

_**"This year I have been forever changed by [Worthy of Love](https://www.facebook.com/worthyoflovela/?hc_location=ufi) which hosts a monthly birthday party for children experiencing homelessness on Skid Row. Once a month on the rooftop of the Union Mission families are invited to celebrate together and remember that every individual is worthy of love. This organization was started by an incredible woman, Mary Davis, who after experiencing a miscarriage with her husband decided to throw a birthday party for children that needed it most because she could not throw one for her own child. Mary is currently 7 months pregnant with a baby girl which means I get to help oversee the August party!! The theme is going to be Follow Your Dreams a Slumber Party. I will be inviting all west coast yellow member to volunteer once I firm up dates!"**_

~  Jennifer Mingucci, New York City Chapter Leader

_**"I am passionate about using the Arts to connect with the homeless community. I believe allowing people to have the space and time to express themselves through any form of art can be healing and transformative. We carve out some time during the week to do exactly that, and it has been so impactful in not only the lives of our neighbors, but our lives as well."**_

~ Sarah Jung, DTLA Chapter Leader

_**"Right now I'm passionate about owning our stories. There is so much power and connection and freedom in our stories and our struggles and joys. Owning our story and sharing it is vital in healing ourselves and our communities. I'm not sure what form this passion will take at the moment, but I'm playing with it."**_

~ Megan Medlock-Elgart, Bay Area Chapter Leader

_**"I'm hungry to mobilize wildly imaginative problem solvers to influence the highest levels of national and global leadership. Having worked in the civic, humanitarian, and philanthropic worlds, I know for a fact that there is plenty of room + a need for new thinking and great ideas. I believe bringing new people to the table, like creatives and disruptors, are essential in finding new and better solutions to long-standing challenges and problems we haven't been able to crack."**_

~ Gabby Almon, The LA Valley Chapter Leader

I believe in the power of words, and when we can articulate what it is that's currently on our hearts and what we're fighting for, it's amazing to see what comes. I encourage you this week, to write down a short few sentences about what it is you're passionate about. Put it out there, and see what comes.
