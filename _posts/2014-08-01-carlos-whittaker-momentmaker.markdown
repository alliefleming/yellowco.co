Happy Friday ladies! We have an awesome giveaway for you today. One of our speakers, Carlos
Whittaker, has recently come out with an awesome book called
[Moment Maker](http://ragamuffinsoul.com/book/). And lucky for you, we are giving away a free copy!
If you haven't heard of this book, get ready. As a creative woman who wants to change the world,

passion. This book will guide and give you direction on how to live that life.

To give you an idea of what this book is about, here's the description from Carlos's site:\
_"In Moment Maker, Carlos shares moments from his own life that have formed his methodology for living
on purpose and with purpose. As you will find in these pages, the beauty of having a moment making life
is that it does not require a big investment in time, energy, or money. It simply requires a commitment
to pay attention._

_Whether Creating, Receiving, or Rescuing a moment, the key component is awareness. All around you
there are opportunities to meet a need, to shift your focus, and to begin healing. You donâ€™t have to
wonder where the time went when you seize every opportunity to wrap life in the breath of God. It is
time to make a difference in your life and the lives of others. It is time to become a Moment
Maker."_

So, how do you win this book, you ask? It's quite simple. Just leave a comment on this post telling
us why you want to become a better #MomentMaker. We will go over the answers and select a winner
next Friday, Aug. 8th. If you want to just want to purchase the book, head over to
[Amazon and grab a copy](http://www.amazon.com/Moment-Maker-Live-Your-Life/dp/0310337976). Heck,
grab a copy, enter the giveaway and give a copy to a friend!
