<p>To give you an idea of what this book is about, here's the description from Carlos' site:<br />
<em>"In Moment Maker, Carlos shares moments from his own life that have formed his methodology for living on purpose and with purpose. As you will find in these pages, the beauty of having a moment making life is that it does not require a big investment in time, energy, or money. It simply requires a commitment to pay attention.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether Creating, Receiving, or Rescuing a moment, the key component is awareness. All around you there are opportunities to meet a need, to shift your focus, and to begin healing. You don&rsquo;t have to wonder where the time went when you seize every opportunity to wrap life in the breath of God. It is time to make a difference in your life and the lives of others. It is time to become a Moment Maker."</em></p>
<p>So, how do you win this book, you ask? It's quite simple. &nbsp;Just leave a comment on this post telling us why you want to become a better #momentmaker.
