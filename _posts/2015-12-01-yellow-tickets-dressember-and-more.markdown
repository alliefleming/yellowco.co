<p class="p1">Happy December 1 everyone! My name is Joanna Waterfall. I&rsquo;m the founder of Yellow Co. and am interrupting this Tuesday&rsquo;s blog post because there is so much good stuff happening in our little Yellow world today I had to take up a full post to tell you about it all.</p></p>
<p class="p1">1- Yellow Conference 2016 tickets are on <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/yellow-conference-2016-tickets-los-angeles-F2Q869" target="_blank">SALE starting today</a>! If you follow us on Instagram, you&rsquo;ve probably seen us posting a bit about our theme for this year. GRIT. VALOR. HEART. I&rsquo;m so excited about this theme because I feel like it sums up the women who are involved in our community so darn well.</p></p>
<h5 data-reactid=".1.1.0.0.2.1.0.0">GRIT: because to make real changes in the world, we need to get our hands dirty. We need to get down into the trenches and place ourselves in the areas we may not be comfortable going. To be willing to sacrifice, to risk, to move, to feel.<br data-reactid=".1.1.0.0.2.1.0.0.1.$newline9/=10" />.<br data-reactid=".1.1.0.0.2.1.0.0.1.$newline11/=10" />VALOR: because bravery matters. To put on our armor and fight for what is right. We need to act, despite our fear, insecurities and doubts. Because our words, our actions and our lives have power. A brave woman is a force to be reckoned with.<br data-reactid=".1.1.0.0.2.1.0.0.1.$newline13/=10" />.<br data-reactid=".1.1.0.0.2.1.0.0.1.$newline15/=10" />HEART: because in everything we do, we must do it with love. With passion, with openness, with vulnerability and intuition. Because we are human, because we are more than flesh and bone. Because we are souls. Because we have spirits capable of deep deep love. We must let it shine, letting it pour into everything we do.</h5></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">We love incorporating our theme into everything we do for our conference. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this one plays out.</span></p></p>
<p class="p1">We have a limited time offer on our pricing. There are 100 tickets available at the early bird price of $275. What a great item to add to your Christmas list, eh?? Or how great of a present would this be for a friend or fam member? Head here for more info on this year&rsquo;s Yellow and here to <a href="https://www.universe.com/events/yellow-conference-2016-tickets-los-angeles-F2Q869" target="_blank">grab your ticket</a>. I really hope you can make it!</p></p>
<p class="p1">2- We are creating a Yellow scholarship fund this year to help send women who may not be able to afford to come to Yellow the opportunity to make it. If you are interested in applying to the scholarship, shoot an email to heygirl@yellowconference.com with the subject line: YELLOW 2016 SCHOLARSHIP. Tell us a bit about yourself and why you want to come to Yellow. If you are interested in donating to the scholarship fund, please email thescoop@yellowconference.com with the subject line SCHOLARSHIP DONATION.</p></p>
<p class="p1">3- <a href="http://www.dressember.org/" target="_blank">Dressember</a> starts today! If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this movement, it&rsquo;s kind of like Movember but for women :) Every day of December women all over the world commit to wearing a dress to raise money to stop human trafficking. Read more about it here, and if you are interested and want to join our team, head to their website to <a href="https://support.dressemberfoundation.org/events/dressember-2015/e59394" target="_blank">make a page</a>.
