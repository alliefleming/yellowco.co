<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been a people pleaser for as long as I can remember. And&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was really, really good at it. Who am I kidding? I am </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">still </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really, really good at it. I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t want to be liked by everyone?&nbsp;On one hand, I enjoy receiving compliments and being placed on a pedestal - but on the other hand, it gets really exhausting. <strong>Living up to everyone&rsquo;s expectations takes up a lot of energy, and too often, it takes a big&nbsp;mental and emotional toll.</strong></span><strong><br />
</strong> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in an Asian culture, I desperately wanted my parents to approve of everything I did, even if it meant sacrificing my dreams, aspirations, and voice. I learned to never disappoint my family, which ultimately transcended into never disappointing my friends, church, coworkers&hellip; you get the gist.</span></p>
<h3><strong>I took this cultural ideal and ran with it, creating a whirlwind of endless expectations for myself.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Doing so led me to&nbsp;become extremely lonely with my emotions and lost in my thoughts. <strong>I answered everyone's questions in way that I knew would make them&nbsp;happy, instead of in a way that led to truth.</strong>&nbsp;</span>I smiled often to mask the pain. I melted down, feeling&nbsp;like I was letting everyone down.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first became a mom, I had a constant battle with myself between the need to appease everyone (while, of course, supporting a new life) versus the need to be open and honest about the hardships of motherhood. Friends would ask, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s being a mom?&rdquo;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;And the people pleaser in me would answer, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I love it so much and wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way!&rdquo;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; The honest&nbsp;me would agree but think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing 90% of the time and I&rsquo;m on the verge of another set of baby blues postpartum.&rdquo;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As much as I wanted to portray having&nbsp;it together, believing&nbsp;that was everyone&rsquo;s expectation of me, the reality was that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> have it together; and that is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">okay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being a mom has taught me to be vocal about my feelings and take ownership of who I am. <strong>To be liberated from falsehoods and stand in freedom.</strong> Although other life events have revealed&nbsp;the struggle of being a people pleaser to me (moving out, going to college, getting married), motherhood has taught me most to be true to myself and my community.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While pleasing others has influenced much of my life, I won&rsquo;t let it define who I want to be. I am learning to take charge of the person I was created to be: a wife, mom, sister, friend, etc.,&nbsp;meant to live outside expectations, including my own. It hasn&rsquo;t been the easiest journey - I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of setbacks, but also of grace. In this season of breaking free, I&rsquo;m thankful to have a husband and a 15-month old smiley boy who love me just as I am, as well as&nbsp;family and friends who accept all that comes with it. So, I will move forward&nbsp;to live in the here and now, and never hold back.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
