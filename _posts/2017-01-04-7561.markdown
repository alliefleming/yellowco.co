  content: Wonderful post Bri! I can relate to this on so many levels. To stand in
    your own truth and let go of expectations placed on you as well as those you internalize
    is such a struggle in and of itself. Thank you for your inspiring words.

    terrifying, honestly. But once they're finally gone it's incredibly freeing!

  content: This post is so timely for me as I just discovered something VERY similar
    and am now trying to navigate what the future could look like.  My husband and
    I lived in Hong Kong for almost 2 years from 2014-2015 and had hoped to stay through
    2016, but life had other plans.  His company was sold and he found a job in Northern
    California- which we were thankful for...but we both missed Hong Kong, me much
    more than him at first.  But it seemed like the right move as I learned I was
    pregnant and we would be closer to friends and family back in the US.  My son
    was born and although I did enjoy having family around, my heart still missed
    HK desperately.  And the fact that Northern California and I didn't really connect,
    made things a bit more challenging.  Well- life had "other plans" again and we
    moved to Southern California, where I am MUCH MUCH happier, however still missing
    our life and friends in Asia.  But my husbands job, although based in LA, still
    requires about 30-50% of the time in Asia so my son and I joined him over there
    for the holidays and I just fell in love with HK all over again.  I had worried
    that I had built it up to be more than it was in my mind, but found that it was
    just as wonderful as I remembered and wanted to go back.  However, what I realized
    was...when we relocated back to the States I thought it meant that I would never
    get to go back and live that life again or have the opportunity to do the things
    that I did over there...but that's not what it means at all.  My current enterprise
    has strong potential in the US AND in Hong Kong and I am now realizing that my
    life could include both Southern California AND Hong Kong!  Yes...we will need
    some very lucrative things to happen financially to support that, but it's not
    impossible at all.  So I'm envisioning a future for my son, my enterprise and
    our family that includes both living domestically and abroad at the same time.  As
    my son is only 7 months old, this is possible for the next few years, until school
    becomes a conversation.  And although my family isn't necessarily excited for
    us to be so far away, they know it is where my heart is and also see it doesn't
    have to be all or nothing.  Thanks for your post and for allowing me to "journal"
    my response, as it always brings such clarity and focus to my thoughts.

  content: 'Hi Bri! Holy smokes! Thank you so much for sharing this, and your honesty
    and authenticity, it is really refreshing and needed. This sentence: "The life
    we expected, the life everyone else expected of us&hellip;it wasn&rsquo;t for
    us." -- I can''t stop thinking about it. In the New Year I have given myself permission
    to mess-up and learn, to explore and follow my path wherever it leads and not
    self-critique (which I notoriously do, out of fear of failure), but I am attempting
    to let go and be free and follow my heart. Thanks again!'

</a>2016 was a year of discovery...of growth...of hope. The number of lists I made I can&rsquo;t even begin to count: <em>goals, pro/cons, grocery lists...</em>A lot of surprising realizations came from these lists. A decision to start grad school, a new calling, an upheaval of our lifestyle. But the most significant decision was one I didn&rsquo;t see coming and one I was afraid to admit needed to happen.</span></p>
<p>A year and a half ago my family and I moved from Southern California back to our home town of Dayton, Ohio. It was a move that we felt we were supposed to do. Everyone kept asking when we were coming back and expected us to make it sooner rather than later. When I discovered I was pregnant with our third child, it seemed like the right thing to do. The time came and we packed up our tiny house and said goodbye to our neighborhood. We moved, like we were supposed to, back <em>&lsquo;home&rsquo;,</em> the same little town I had grown up in. For a while it worked. Everything seemed to fit. We carried on as we were supposed to: a family of five in a quiet suburban town with amazing schools, countless trees, a walkable grocery and family all around.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>I started to make a list of 100 goals I wanted to achieve in my lifetime.</strong> A list of what direction I saw my life heading, where I wanted to be, what I wanted to do, the kind of lifestyle I dreamed of for my children. It quickly became apparent that this quiet little town that I was supposed to spend my life in didn&rsquo;t align with many of my goals. When I shared my thoughts and my list with my husband, he revealed that he had been dreaming up a similar list and had come to the same conclusion: </span><b><i>our future is in Southern California.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC0352-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7563 size-full" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC0352-2.jpg" alt="_dsc0352-2" width="2048" height="1356" /></a></i></b>It took months to admit to ourselves. That the life we expected, the life everyone else expected of us...it wasn&rsquo;t for us. We both grew up safe and secure but never knowing what was really beyond the expected. Go to college, get a job, get married, have babies, move close to family. That was the life. When the Marine Corps moved us out to California unexpectedly, we were devastated. So far from what we had considered &lsquo;home&rsquo; so different from our cushy Midwestern lifestyle, we didn&rsquo;t know what to think. Didn&rsquo;t know how to acclimate. We didn&rsquo;t think we could or should stay. But being away and being faced with the stark differences in culture and mindset, we began to realize that we had created our own &lsquo;home&rsquo; in California. And while our house and budget were tiny, our hopes and dreams and futures were vast.</p>
<p>So now there&rsquo;s a massive challenge before us: leaving our cushy midwest house, our adorable suburban neighborhood, our new friends and close family for a significantly more difficult and perhaps uneasy life.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC0321.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7562" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DSC0321.jpg" alt="_dsc0321" width="2048" height="1356" /></a>I read recently a quote from Joseph Campbell that has been repeating over and over in my head:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong><i>&ldquo;If you can see the path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it&rsquo;s not your path. Your own path you make with every step you take.&rdquo;</i></strong></blockquote><br />
I was following a path that had been laid out for me by my parents and society; by nearly everyone before me. I was, and still am, terrified to admit that this path, this safe and &lsquo;normal&rsquo; life in Ohio is not my path. My path is yet to be discovered. I don&rsquo;t know all of the steps, I don&rsquo;t know exactly where it will lead me. I know that I&rsquo;ll have to forge some tumultuous waters, climb a mountain or two, get my hands dirty in this unfamiliar earth. But I also know that whatever path I make for myself will be the right one. It will lead to where I&rsquo;m supposed to be. And right now, the next step on my path is to head back to California. I&rsquo;ll desperately miss so much about where we are now, but I&rsquo;m clinging to the tug in my heart that tells me I&rsquo;m doing the right thing.</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow your heart, despite the voices screaming for you to stay put. Your path has not yet been laid, only you can do that.</span></em></p>
