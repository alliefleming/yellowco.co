I felt defeated and, perhaps, a little ashamed and less than worthy to be in the ranks of other entrepreneurs out there, who seem to always hit their mark. Their projects fly high, while I was left trying to figure out why mine seemed to flat line.</p>
<p>Every entrepreneur has been there many more times than they&rsquo;d like to count, and there is no guarantee that they&rsquo;ll ever be immune to having to face it again. But every entrepreneurial failure is actually the biggest indication of being on the right track. It&rsquo;s a natural byproduct of the entrepreneurial journey.</p>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Think back to the children&rsquo;s game of &ldquo;hot and cold.&rdquo; If you were far from the prize, you&rsquo;d hear &ldquo;cold,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;d move in another direction. This is exactly how entrepreneurial failures work. Each time something doesn&rsquo;t pan out, you&rsquo;re being nudged to pivot and redirect. By doing so, you&rsquo;re not only getting closer to the gold, but you&rsquo;re also creating new opportunities for yourself.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Learn the lessons</strong></h2><br />
There&rsquo;s so much to learn when you&rsquo;re unleashing your creativity &ndash; how you work, what your limits are, where your zone of genius lies, what you like, what you don&rsquo;t, and the list goes on. Whether mental blocks came up or you took a risk at adding a new element to your work, there&rsquo;s always a lesson to be learned. Take note and don&rsquo;t lose heart.</p>
<h2><strong>Reassess your intentions</strong></h2><br />
It&rsquo;s extremely easy to get so wrapped up in a project and lose sight of what really matters. Go back to basics and remember why you started in the first place. Now is a good time to anchor back into your why. You&rsquo;ll find solace and motivation there, as well as inspiration to keep going.</p>
<h2><strong>Explore other avenues</strong></h2><br />
There is never only one single road to get to a destination. When there&rsquo;s traffic on the road, you find shortcuts. When it&rsquo;s blocked, you take a detour. When a project feels derailed, it&rsquo;s time to go around. Research other ways to further your reach. Find creative ways to connect with your audience. Discover new opportunities to get your message out. The saying goes, &ldquo;When there&rsquo;s a will, there&rsquo;s a way.&rdquo; So, get it girl!<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

When creating something from scratch and working alone, we&rsquo;re prone to some serious tunnel vision. Sometimes projects need a fresh pair of eyes and ears. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out to others and see what they think. Doing so will allow you to rework the project with a different lens and come in at a whole new angle.</p>
<h2><strong>Celebrate the failure</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><br />
Failures need some love, too! Down the road, you&rsquo;ll see that every single failure was a lead up to success. It&rsquo;s like picking out the right pair of shoes to go with that amazing outfit. Nothing gets you closer to finding that perfect pair than trying, trying, and trying again. So pop some bubbly if you wish, and toast to getting that much closer to your end goal.</p>
<h2><strong>Take a &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for self care</strong></h2><br />
It&rsquo;s time to pat yourself on the back for fearlessly putting yourself out into the world, taking a chance, and following your heart. Schedule time with some girl friends, treat yourself to a quiet reading day, or head to the spa. Do something for yourself. Do whatever it takes to make your heart feel full again. You deserve it. You are worthy. You will make it happen.</p>

Keep persisting. Stay determined. Hustle with heart. You will find your footing, and when you do, that little bump on the road will be just another tiny drop in the bucket. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to fail, because failure will always be pointing you in the right direction.</p>
