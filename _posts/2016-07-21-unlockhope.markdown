  content: "All people should have the opportunity to thrive through access to quality
    education and healthcare, starting with ridding every house in America of lead.
    If the home is not a safe place to be, how can someone have a chance later? \n\nWith
    everything being done to combat this, I struggle to comprehend how lead has yet
    to be eradicated. It is common knowledge that lead has horrifying and damaging
    effects on the mind and body, yet it is still present in many homes.\n\nLead poisoning
    plagues lower socio-economic communities, particularly in Baltimore where I work.
    It can cause brain damage that leads to poor development, lower academic ability,
    and major bouts of violence. Rather than looking at poorer communities as places
    of violence, maybe we should see that we are sentencing these communities to a
    life of struggle and pain with no opportunities to succeed when we refuse to give
    them a healthy place to live.\n\nI am a designer, and therefore I want to use
    design to change this. It is my hope that there can be comprehensive policy change
    using design in cities. It is my belief that good design is the core of a well
    functioning city, and I hope to implement this in my future.\n\nI could use the
    Yellow Conference to help inspire me to see who I should be talking to and how
    I can use design more effectively for positive change."

    I want to help empower working women to believe they can have a happy and successful life both for their career and their families. The corporate world is a rough world for women and moms in particular so I'd like to contribute to giving women the support they need.

    The Yellow Conference would help with inspiration and in meeting other creative go-getters!

  content: "I started my first business less than 6 months ago, and one of the social
    issues I have found in this time is that people expect young professionals to
    immediately back down when a \"veteran\" of the business has walked in. I believe
    in respecting the hard work others have put into create a strong foundation to
    what I have now walked into... what amazes me is how quickly they are to dismiss
    the successes of our young professionals. We are successful not because of luck
    but because we have the same drive and passion as our successors. We are successful
    because we want to see change everywhere, we believe in diverse solutions, diverse
    teams for the most diverse ideas. The rapid growth of technology and the ability
    to have the world at your fingertips should promote a universal eagerness to excel
    further than imagined. Although this is geared towards our young professionals
    I believe socially it is a problem in everything. People should be applauded for
    striving to build communities that expect its members to support and not compete,
    to lift and not bury, and to believe and not doubt. \n\nWhat's holding me back?
    Our world is constantly changing around us. Everything is growing so quickly.
    How do I maintain consistency and still build off the momentum around me? I must
    discover how I grow with the world and still be who I am and allow my business
    to do the same? I believe coming to the Yellow Conference will help me find those
    answers because I will be surrounded by women who are experiencing the same fears,
    who have found their own paths, who I could guide, and who could guide me. Being
    around other people that will challenge me to reach further, stop doubting, and
    believe in what I have to offer the world is exactly why I want to come to the
    conference."

    and knowledge of self  through the arts. I'd  love to expand something I started
    called The Creative Brunch Series into a non-profit and offer more opportunities
    to gain access to multicultural workshops, classes, etc. for ALL people. I'm an
    artist and feel held back by my ignorance of the business side of things. The
    Yellow Conference would not only help me gain access to a network of entrepreneurs
    and valuable insights but it would also ignite passion and drive to continue on

  content: "The social issue that I want to change is how Muslim women are perceived
    by the larger world, but also how we (I am a Muslim woman) perceive each other
    due to the societal, cultural, and media perspectives that color our judgments.
    I want to work on addressing issues that are considered taboo within Muslim countries
    and they differ from one to other in severity, but there always tends to be an
    overarching theme, just like in the States i.e. sex. So, pretty much, I want to
    push the envelopes within the Muslim world's perception of women and the way that
    the Western world perceives us as well. \nWhat's holding me back is a multitude
    of factors, mainly, I've become aware of the fear of putting myself out there
    and addressing issues that can be deemed as contentious and the vitriol that will
    most likely accompany it. That fear ties into others, but it's also part of the
    transformation that I have been going through professionally, where I know what
    I want now more than ever, but I am unsure and scared about how to start this
    thing and make a living from it. I'm at the point in my life where I don't want
    to settle for less than, especially when it comes to what I do for a living as
    it's very important for me that what I do is tied into my values and provides
    a sense of fulfillment. It's something that I've been searching for for the past
    seven years through many trials and tribulations, and have finally realized in
    the past year or so, that it is I who has to make this reality. \nI believe that
    attending the Yellow Conference will help in many ways, most importantly through
    exposure to other women who are leading the way, and that can shine a light for
    the rest of us. I also feel that it will provide a source of strength and guidance
    that I need at this point of deep transformation both personally and professionally."

  content: "Like many, I had been on many short term mission trips (mainly in Africa
    but several other countries as well).  My heart was warmed to the devastations
    that plagued people in poverty and yet I felt stuck.  I didn't know what to do
    with that.  I ended up at New York University, in one of the most expensive nonprofit
    master degree programs in the nation, with tons of students loans, and yet still
    no one taught me what to do with all the compassion that was about to implode
    within me.  \n\nAfter graduation I spent a lot of time getting jobs that were
    secure to pay student loans only frustrated with the things the Lord had shown
    me oversees and no outlet to help other than fundraise for causes I was passionate
    about.  Finally one day I realized my passion was the empower the church (every
    Christian) to take their passion and use it to impact the lives of those in need.
    \ \n\nMy vision is to create an online university substitute/trade school
    for Christians all over the world to take their compassion for a specific cause
    and turn it into a mission that impacts the world.  I want to educate and train
    passionate Christians on how to not simply use a nonprofit structure but combine
    the for profit and nonprofit structures to create a social enterprise that is
    financially self sustaining.  This will allow greater impact because they are
    not spending 80% of their time fundraising.  The online school would be a two
    semester program where students would be matched with mentors, given practical
    curriculum/homework, and coaching that guarantees their business to be up
    and running by the end of the course.  My passion is to create change makers for
    global GOOD!  My passion is to take all those whose hearts are warmed by problems
    that plague others and funnel their passion into powerful world changing missions!
    \ And, my passion is to make this accessible to the everyday person, without the
    six-figure loans.  We need more world changer and there is too much compassion
    going to waste right now. \n\nI did the simulcast of the Yellow Conference last
    year but I want more!  Being able to actually attend the Yellow Conference will
    help me not only build relationships with many inspiring people and make connections
    with those that might also share a similar vision.  Attending Yellow would also
    allow me to glean from the wisdom of some fabulously innovative entrepreneurs
    who are positive change agents in our world.  I would be honored to win this opportunity!"

    foster system. My husband's company moved us out to Oklahoma for a couple years
    and with our church there we would volunteer in the state home that houses children
    waiting to go to a foster home. I will never forget when I asked the lady running
    it what I could do to help that day and she said \"just rock the babies, they
    do not have enough human touch.\" Needless to say my heart was forever changed
    that day. I would love to learn how my business could partner up with some of
    the homes and actually make a difference. These tiny babies and children are our
    future and they deserve love and attention. \nThank you so much for this opportunity,
    I have always wanted to attend the Yellow Conference. "

    everywhere have safe and reliable access to healthcare.  I currently volunteer
    with an organization called "Days for Girls," which provides period kits to women
    in developing countries so they can stay in work in school, even if they happen
    to be bleeding.  It's an amazing organization, and I am privileged to be a strategic
    partner...the problem is that I need better time management and more accountability
    and connection to make the impact I want to make.  I'd love to get a chance to
    share with the women of Yellow.

    Economic deprivation is a huge issue in the UK and in Birmingham where I live
    we have some of the highest rates of deprivation in Western Europe where 1 in

    especially with the proposed tax cuts women are 80% affected negatively and we
    have one of the highest rates of childcare in Europe. \n\nI run a network called
    Women Who and I would happily fly to LA if I win as I would love to connect with
    like minded women worldwide and also collaborate globally. \n\nI did email a few
    months ago (cheekily) asking if you were seeking any international speakers yet
    I'm more than happy to come soak up the knowledge and huge sprinkles of inspiration

  content: |-
    Over the course of my career, I have again and again found myself different from the people and the world that surrounds me. Among a group that is &ldquo;drinking the cool-aid&rdquo; of corporate culture, I can&rsquo;t seem to find the meaning in what we do every day. In fact, I don&rsquo;t believe that anything I&rsquo;ve done in my career has ever been important or had an impact on something that matters&hellip;even though most of the projects I work on are treated as life or death situations. My significant other is a paramedic, so it feels so surreal to see my workplace &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo; in stark contrast to his ACTUAL emergencies. Being with him has helped me to realize that most of what we do every day doesn&rsquo;t matter.

    After a year of intense burnout, I gained a lot of clarity. I now see the life I want to build as an artist working for social good, and that vision gets clearer and clearer every day. So what&rsquo;s holding me back? I want to say time, money, and disorganization&hellip;but the real answer is fear. I don&rsquo;t know how to survive in this new life and I find myself afraid to give up a meager weekly paycheck when I don&rsquo;t have a net to catch me if I fall.

    Attending the Yellow Conference would put me in a space with like-minded people who are on a similar mission. It would give me the support system I so desperately need to conquer this fear. The Yellow Conference would be the catalyst for making my dream a reality.

  content: "Hello! \n\nI'm from the midwest and I want to promote awareness and support
    for people that are going through struggles with infertility. Including awareness
    for those who have gone through or will go through miscarriages. It is still such
    a stigma today and no one talks about it. I feel like women's health has gone
    by the wayside as we treat things that are more acceptable to talk about and most
    doctors actually have no idea how to help women dealing with these issues! \n\nI
    can't believe that we live in a society today where women feel ashamed to talk
    about infertility or loss. Where other women and men make terrible and hurtful
    comments because they truly have no idea what many people are going through. I
    can't believe that when I had a miscarriage my husband didn't want me to tell
    anyone, because people just didn't talk about that. He obviously has changed his
    stance on it. But the fact that anyone out there feels that way is such a travesty.
    We have been trying for over 3 years and it has been over 2 years since our loss.
    And FINALLY I feel like I have been heard and all I want to do is help other women
    who are or will be going through this. It's not fair to anyone to keep it silent.
    \n\nI think this would empower so many women, and men. And it would help fix this
    growing issue of infertility by getting people to talk about it. I feel like going
    to the Yellow Conference will help me get a grasp on what I need to do to make
    this a reality.\n\nI type this and as I type I take a break to read some of the
    comments from the wonderful women below and think wow. There are so many women
    with great dreams and a wonderful vision. I believe anyone that you send would
    be wonderful. These two tickets will be such a blessing to an amazing cause and
    I am so glad you are doing this!"

    ends meet and got a crash course on budgeting/managing money. I'd really love
    to help lower-income women with their finances since basic personal finance is
    not taught in school.  I feel once you have  a basic understanding you can change

  content: "I want to approach social change in a holistic way that can address multiple
    areas of need at once: to economically empower marginalized communities both locally
    and internationally.  I want my current business to generate deeper and more sustainable
    impact through international trade and relationships as well as have a local social
    impact by empowering underserved youth through employment and life skills training.\n\nI
    started a chocolate company to get into an industry where I could do both of these
    things. With experience in international development through nonprofit work, I
    wanted to translate possible impact from the NGO sector to a business platform
    in the US. \n\nMy company (Hello Cocoa Chocolate) is approaching our second year
    on August 1, and the path to achieving these goals remains fuzzy and out of reach,
    but my deepest desire is to make business matter. To learn from and join the other
    entrepreneurs who are actually generating change in communities and in the ways
    businesses function. \n\nI want my business to empower cacao farmers and their
    entire communities while also providing jobs and life skills to marginalized youth
    in our local community.  \n\nI feel held back by a lack of leadership and community
    that can share wisdom and practical approaches to building a business in a way
    that's fueled by social change.  I believe I can actually achieve these dreams
    by surrounding myself with leaders that are already doing this (and doing it well).
    I would be grateful for the opportunity to learn from the Yellow Conference leaders
    and community to make these business dreams possible."

    that I am attempting to address is the negative impact that our economy has had
    on our ability to be fully present with our families. In helping people to "become
    their own boss" I assist in helping my clients create their own source of wealth,
    while creating a schedule that is conducive to family life. With families falling
    apart with increasing frequency, I want to do my part in creating change. Attending
    the conference would give me a great opportunity to hear from other women entrepreneurs
    regarding what their specific needs are, and will give me some insight into how
    we can best solve these systemic problems together.

    asked me what I wanted to do for a living. As far as which social issue I want
    to address, I honestly don't have that answer nailed down yet, but the calling
    to do more than just work a job is prominent. I think right now it's the lack
    of clarity that is holding me back. I truly believe the Yellow Conference would
    be an incredible next step for me since it would create the margin for me to hone
    in on what it is that God is calling me to pursue.

  content: I had a life breakthrough just recently. I left my very corporate, very
    stressful job after years of struggling with the fact that it was not aligned
    with the person I wanted to be. I worked in a male-dominated industry and constantly
    had to fight for myself and my opinions. The corporate ladder always looked like
    a challenge that I had placed value in being that independent women who could
    prove herself and reach the top. The title and the paycheck gave me a sense of
    self worth because I was doing it all on my own. When I finally left, I left in
    pieces from the destruction it had caused in my own certainty about myself and
    my relationships with others. All of a sudden I had no identity. I had no real
    plan, I just chose 'me" for the first time ever. I did the only thing that came
    to mind - travel. I spent 3 months in South America trying to dig deep to the
    part of me that was still there deep down within me, buried underneath the years
    of social conditioning that I had allowed in my life. I have been back about two
    months and, for the first time in a long time, I have the undying urge to C R
    E A T E. More importantly, I want to work with/for other independent women
    who have or had that same value placed on being an independent female, climbing
    the ladder, proving your worth, fighting for acknowledgement in a (sometimes male-dominant)
    hostile environment. Not to say they should quit like I did, but that there are
    ways to take that life with stride and grace. I want to support the importance
    of work-life balance. I want to take all my passions and combine them into something
    that helps people. I am in the beginning phases of creating a wellness retreat
    company where I combine my love of yoga, sound healing/energy healing with
    outdoor adventures all over the world with people who want to explore a deeper,
    more meaningful life. And I am doing it with my best friend. What is better than
    that?! We would be super grateful to attend the Yellow Conference and meet other
    inspiring women who are creating their lives as we finally are. Thank you for
    the opportunity! :)

    up-to-date resources and interactive programs through partnerships with organizations,
    small business owners and corporations. When there is lack of resources and programs,
    our communities suffer. My life goal is to ensure that communities have access
    to resources which will improve their lives and the lives of their children. Currently,
    my focus is to develop an interactive program for foster youth. Foster youth are
    the most underserved youth and deserve to be recognized and assisted with meeting
    their academic and career goals. What's holding me back is finding others who
    are willing to go on this journey with me. Attending the Yellow Conference will
    assist me in finding a wealth of knowledge, resources and people who are ready
    to make positive changes in communities all over the world.

    Education. I passionately believe education changes the world. Within the realm of education, writing is a powerful medium that empowers people to express their ideas and beliefs. Even more basic than that, it&rsquo;s an essential skill needed in college applications, writing cover letters, emails, even succeeding in interviews. But to many, writing is intimidating drudgery. And many don&rsquo;t have the resources or opportunities to learn. I want to demystify writing to people who &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t writers.&rdquo;

    Quite simply, I want to use my writing for good. I believe (and know it&rsquo;s possible!) that our careers and doing good shouldn&rsquo;t be mutually exclusive, but a combination of fear and uncertainty how to take my ideas beyond the brainstorming phase have left me feeling like I&rsquo;m at a standstill. I&rsquo;ve followed the Yellow Conference blog and organization for a long time and feel like it is the perfect embodiment of what I&rsquo;m struggling to articulate. The community of like-minded individuals would be a wonderful opportunity to connect with others, hear their stories (one of my favorite things!) and set actionable steps to achieve my dreams and make an impact bigger than myself.

    about our mission is that we are "filling in the cracks". We are supporting smaller,

    PNG. We get to support nonprofits working in the areas of domestic violence, sorcery
    killings, education, women's health, entrepreneurship, family sexual assault,
    children affected by HIV/AIDS, street kids, the list goes on! But one area
    there is a lack of aid/awareness already in place is with human sex trafficking.  It
    is a growing problem and I know it especially needs our attention. I've so much
    to learn but am moving forward with purpose and intention.  I think what holds
    me back the most is sometimes wavering confidence in my ability to do the work
    ahead and lack of mentorship.  I simply don't know a lot of people doing what
    I'm doing!  I have always wanted to attend the Yellow Conference to learn from
    and be inspired by women who are making a difference and started small just like
    I am, with the passion to do something to make this world a better place, to solve
    the problem they see the most.  The funds have never been available so I'm excited
    about the possibility of winning tickets!  I appreciate the opportunity. ?

  content: "Health care preventing the deaths of mom's &amp; babies in Haiti. Through
    supporting MamaBaby Haiti (www.mamababyhaiti.org) we can save the lives of mom's
    and babies. Haiti has the highest infant and maternal mortality rate in the Western
    Hemisphere. 98% of these deaths are preventable. I want to start a business in
    which a large portion of the profits go to support MamaBaby Haiti and organizations
    like this that are making an impact. Happy Home for the Handicapped cares for
    orphaned handicapped children in India (www.indiahappyhome.org). \n\nMy mission
    would be to give people the opportunity to support these established organizations
    and they will know that their purchase isn't just a purchase - its an opportunity.
    It's a chance to join in a movement to change the lives of others and in some
    cases actually SAVE a LIFE. (mom's &amp; babies)\n\nWhat holds me back is lack
    of knowledge, motivation (can I really make a difference?) for starting up a business
    and the finances to do it. By attending the Yellow Conference I believe I would
    have gained more knowledge from others who have gone before me in similar endeavors
    and be inspired to move forward. Hearing others' stories of success and challenges
    they face would boost my confidence in this business venture. Inspired by speakers
    at the conference and having a network of others to go to for questions, mentoring,
    feedback is important to me in order to move forward. Thank you for the opportunity
    to attend this conference."

    I believe that there is a lack of community and Latina voices in the media and
    creative fields. I believe that by encouraging young women to be in charge of
    their voices, body's and minds you are setting them up for growth and success.
    As a recent college graduate I know how crucial that is. Like I said, I am a recent

  content: "Happy Friday!\nAs a new mother, one issue I'm very passionate about changing
    is the notion that a new mom has something to prove. Proving she is not 'just'
    a mother, that she hasn't lost herself, and look! she still maintains her hobbies
    while running ragged on 4 hours of sleep, working a full-time job, and fulfilling
    the 10 other roles she has in life. All women are superwomen. With today's mentality
    of \"are you doing enough?\", new mothers can quickly feel less than. Allow time
    to adjust to one of the biggest transitions of your life. And lose yourself to
    it! It's only in the losing of your 'self', that you can find the true essence
    of who you really are. More to say on my new blog ----> www.mominmanolos.com\n\nI
    feel held back because I haven't found my tribe of new mothers yet who are willing
    to peel back the layers of image management and get real. Really real. This parenting
    thing is tough. How can we band together and help new mothers find their footing
    without the added pressure of doing it all? As I've followed this blog, I am constantly
    impressed and inspired by the quotes, the women behind the posts, and the overall
    message to women to simply radiate who they are. \n\nThank you for being who you
    are and doing what you do!"

  content: "Hola!\n\nA social issue I'm desiring to change is the underlying racism
    that is still present in society today.  I think there are reasons to why there
    are social and community establishments that are predominantly white, black, Hispanic,
    etc.  Is everyone attending those events/functions racist?  Not at all.  But
    what I am saying is maybe we need to intentionally mix it up a bit.  I personally
    am someone who loves to explore new parts of my city, Dallas, TX.  Even when certain
    areas are predominantly a certain race or even certain class, it's so fun for
    me to be the change in scenery!  I think it helps myself become stronger in spirit
    and aware of my fellow brothers and sisters AND I believe it also helps my fellow
    brothers and sisters by changing up what is typically their comfort zone in race
    and/or class.  Soon, individual comfort zones will include all types of colors!
    \ So in reality, it starts with me!  Attending the Yellow Conference will help
    me in getting in the mix and allow me to shower grace and love on all the attendees
    I meet!  My own actions, my own grace, my own love could aide someone else who
    might struggle with diversity. "

    how loved they are because everyone absolutely needs to hear that. I feel like
    photos can be such an encouraging way to show people the beauty they carry inside
    and outside. When you can capture someone''s genuine laugh, or genuine smile,
    or even sadness, they learn its ok to feel anything they are feeling, despite

  content: "My heart burns for reconciliation. There is a lot of tension in our nation
    right now between different people groups and it breaks my heart. I am incredibly
    thankful for tools like social media and the internet where people who may not
    feel like they have a voice otherwise can speak up. However, the problem with
    that at times is I feel like people come to the podium shouting and defensive
    because they are so afraid of not being heard. All this leads to is a lot of noise,
    but no one is actually walking away feeling understood. \n\nMy heart is to see
    people come together and really hear each other. I want us to have the tough conversations
    that lead to true freedom and unity. The kind that causes us to come together,
    peel open our chest and reveal our hearts to those sitting around the table. I
    believe that what our nation needs now more than ever is people who aren't afraid
    to be vulnerable. I believe this is also a special oppurtunity for creatives to
    use their gifts to bring people together. A creative soul has the ability to express
    vulnerability through their art, and this vulnerability gives others the courage
    to be real as well.\n\nAs a writer, I tend to bear my soul with my words. My struggle
    in all of this is sometimes feeling alone. I think a big part of what keeps you
    going in the creative process is being surrounded with like minded people. The
    Yellow Conference would be such an amazing opportunity for me to connect with
    other passionate souls. As an extrovert, relationship feeds me and I believe wholeheartedly
    that iron sharpens iron.  It would be such an incredible honor to get the chance
    to learn and gather inspiration from incredible women. And although there are
    many different conferences out there, what makes this particular one shine to
    me is the fact that its one that comes from a place of being your true self and
    lifting up those around you. It discourages falling into comparison and competition."

    structure encased by wispy green trees and willowy pines. My father lived there
    as a boy, and his father before him, and his father before him, a long line of
    hardworking farmers with unyielding loyalty to the untamed golden prairie. This
    spring, the big blue farmhouse burned to the ground in the midst of the worst
    wildfire in Kansas history. As heartbroken as I was to lose a place that meant
    so much to my family, however, the experience taught me that home is not a place
    but a community of people who know you the best and love you the most. I am currently
    writing a book about what home means to 20-somethings and the importance of being
    rooted in a place and grounded in a community. \n\nIn the process of researching
    for the book, I discovered that at least 70% of California state prison inmates
    have been in the foster care system at some point in their lives. I was shocked
    to hear this unbelievably high statistic, but at the same time I understand how
    it can be true: without a strong support system to anchor an individual, it is
    far too easy to get in with the wrong crowd or make bad decisions. I would like
    to find a way to help those in foster care experience a more stable environment
    and interact with more individuals who believe in them, perhaps by starting a
    mentorship program or after-school writing club. I would love to attend the Yellow
    Conference because I know it would help me identify steps I can take to meet practical
    needs in my community and turn this vision into a reality. I would also love the
    opportunity to spend more time around those who are already involved in social
    justice outreaches to learn from their experiences."

Thank you so much to all who entered! Please stay tuned for more opportunities to win conference tickets and more!</strong></em></p>

Read this post to find out how!" width="700" height="1529" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Tell us a little about <a href="https://unlockhope.com/" target="_blank">Unlock Hope</a>-What's the story?</strong><strong>&nbsp;How did it start? What's the mission?</strong></p>
<p>It all started when I watched the documentary <em><a href="http://invisiblechildren.com/" target="_blank">"Invisible Children."</a></em>&nbsp; I&nbsp;was heartbroken by the situation in Uganda and wanted to do something about it.&nbsp; Before seeing the movie, I knew very little about Uganda so&nbsp;I started researching and found the lack of girls'&nbsp;education was a key element in the issues the country is facing.</p>
<p><strong>On the surface our mission is to simply educate girls in Uganda.</strong> And while&nbsp;that's true, it&rsquo;s only one part of what it's about. I am passionate about&nbsp;justice, equality and causing change and there happens to be a big opportunity to&nbsp;further that through educating girls in Uganda. Nelson Mandela described it perfectly when he said, <em>&ldquo;Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your partnership with Think Humanity... How have you seen this partnership succeed?&nbsp;How did you find Think Humanity, and decide to partner with them?</strong></p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.thinkhumanity.org/" target="_blank">Think Humanity</a> through researching ways to make a difference in Uganda.&nbsp; I was immediately drawn to the fact that they were a small, efficient organization.&nbsp; It is run by a small group of volunteers and a shocking 99% of donations are used directly to fund their programs.&nbsp; They had just started a hostel program where they took in 30 refugee girls and provided them with a safe place to live, nutritious meals, health care and, most importantly, access to quality education.&nbsp; <strong><em>This is the same program that we now fully fund through the sale of our products</em>.</strong>&nbsp; I do what I do best (marketing, sales, product design) and they do what they do best (taking great care of the girls in Uganda).&nbsp; The key to any&nbsp;successful partnership is to allow that to happen without getting in&nbsp;the way of the other.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TEXT-BOX-11.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6210" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TEXT-BOX-11.jpg" alt="Want a chance to win 2 two-day passes to Yellow Conference 2016? Read this post to find out how!" width="700" height="317" /></a></strong></em></span><strong>What are some stories of success for Unlock Hope and Think Humanity?</strong></p>
<p>While the obvious benefits such as access to fresh healthy food, shelter,&nbsp;safety, and healthcare can be seen on a daily basis,&nbsp;the greatest success hasn't yet been realized.&nbsp;<strong> The impact of educating these girls will be felt&nbsp;for generations.</strong>&nbsp; There is an African proverb that says <em>&ldquo;When you educate a girl, you educate a nation.&rdquo;<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6190" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg" alt="Unlock Hope for Yellow Co. Blog" width="700" height="700" /></a></em><strong>What were some hurdles you overcame in building a do-good business?</strong></p>
<p>Early on the biggest hurdle was skepticism but lately the biggest hurdle is competition.&nbsp; Or at least the idea of it.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are so many great causes out there and it's okay to support them all.&nbsp;At events people will often will say things like <em>"this is amazing but&nbsp;I support this other organization"</em> or <em>"our church supports this&nbsp;mission so we give all of our money to that."</em>&nbsp; Just because you&nbsp;support one thing doesn't mean you can't support another if it&rsquo;s a cause that you believe in.&nbsp; There's no&nbsp;such thing as doing too much good.</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide to pursue building a social-good business?<br />
</strong><br />
My absolute favorite quote is by Howard Thurman:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go&nbsp;do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.&rdquo; <strong>(Side note from Yellow Co.: Hey! Ours too!)</strong></em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even set out to build a business at all.&nbsp; I just wanted to make a difference and I ended up finding a way to make it easy for other people to get involved and make a difference.&nbsp; Up until a year ago I had another business that I worked on in addition to doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel&nbsp;truly passionate about something, then you don't really have a choice&nbsp;but to pursue it and throw yourself into it.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine putting this much effort into&nbsp;something that I wasn't passionate about.&nbsp; Find something that makes&nbsp;you "come alive" and that in itself is "social-good." &nbsp;Most of the&nbsp;problems in the world could be solved simply by people deciding to do&nbsp;what they are passionate about and were created to do.</p>

<span style="color: #000000;"> Most people think of valor as courage but it really has more to do&nbsp;with worth.&nbsp; To me valor is simply having the audacity to be your true&nbsp;self.&nbsp; You don't have to be "this" or "that".&nbsp; You were created to be&nbsp;"other." &nbsp;Your uniqueness is where you will find your worth.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;see it as something to be implemented only in business but as something to&nbsp;be embodied in all aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our readers?</strong></p>
<p><em>Vote with your dollars.</em>&nbsp; You do this multiple times a day whether you&nbsp;realize it or not. It's one of the best ways to truly create&nbsp;change.&nbsp; You have more power than you think.&nbsp; Support companies that align with your values and beliefs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know it's not always possible, but when the opportunity presents itself&nbsp;go ahead and spend the few extra dollars.&nbsp; Not only are you giving&nbsp;that money to something you believe in but you're also taking it away from&nbsp;something that you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; People are so passionate about certain causes, but when faced with an opportunity to do something about it we often opt&nbsp;for saving a few bucks.&nbsp; Money drives the world and can be a powerful weapon when used for good.&nbsp; Gandhi said, <em>&ldquo;Action expresses priorities.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; A lot of times people think awareness is enough but that means nothing without action.</p>
