What's the mission?** It all started when I watched the documentary _["Invisible Children."](http://invisiblechildren.com/)_  I was heartbroken by the situation in Uganda and wanted to do something about it.  Before seeing the movie, I knew very little about Uganda so I started researching and found the lack of girls' education was a key element in the issues the country is facing. **On the surface our mission is to simply educate girls in Uganda.** And while that's true, it’s only one part of what it's about. I am passionate about justice, equality and causing change and there happens to be a big opportunity to further that through educating girls in Uganda. Nelson Mandela described it perfectly when he said, _“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” _ **Tell us about your partnership with Think Humanity... How have you seen this partnership succeed? How did you find Think Humanity, and decide to partner with them?** I found [Think Humanity](http://www.thinkhumanity.org/) through researching ways to make a difference in Uganda.  I was immediately drawn to the fact that they were a small, efficient organization.  It is run by a small group of volunteers and a shocking 99% of donations are used directly to fund their programs.  They had just started a hostel program where they took in 30 refugee girls and provided them with a safe place to live, nutritious meals, health care and, most importantly, access to quality education.  **_This is the same program that we now fully fund through the sale of our products_.**  I do what I do best (marketing, sales, product design) and they do what they do best (taking great care of the girls in Uganda).  The key to any successful partnership is to allow that to happen without getting in the way of the other. _**[![Want a chance to win 2 two-day passes to Yellow Conference 2016?

Blog](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg)_**What were some hurdles you overcame in building a do-good business?** Early on the biggest hurdle was skepticism but lately the biggest hurdle is competition.  Or at least the idea of it.  There are so many great causes out there and it's okay to support them all. At events people will often will say things like _"this is amazing but I support this other organization"_ or _"our church supports this mission so we give all of our money to that."_  Just because you support one thing doesn't mean you can't support another if it’s a cause that you believe in.  There's no such thing as doing too much good. **How did you decide to pursue building a social-good business? ** My absolute favorite quote is by Howard Thurman: _“Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” **(Side note from Yellow Co.: Hey! Ours too!)**_ I didn’t even set out to build a business at all.  I just wanted to make a difference and I ended up finding a way to make it easy for other people to get involved and make a difference.  Up until a year ago I had another business that I worked on in addition to doing this.  If you feel truly passionate about something, then you don't really have a choice but to pursue it and throw yourself into it.  I couldn't imagine putting this much effort into something that I wasn't passionate about.  Find something that makes you "come alive" and that in itself is "social-good."  Most of the problems in the world could be solved simply by people deciding to do what they are passionate about and were created to do.

Blog](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2016/07/IMG_4687.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2016/07/IMG_4687.jpg)**What does VALOR mean to you and how do you implement it into your business? ** Most people think of valor as courage but it really has more to do with worth.  To me valor is simply having the audacity to be your true self.  You don't have to be "this" or "that".  You were created to be "other."  Your uniqueness is where you will find your worth.  I don't see it as something to be implemented only in business but as something to be embodied in all aspects of life. **Any advice for our readers?** _Vote with your dollars._  You do this multiple times a day whether you realize it or not. It's one of the best ways to truly create change.  You have more power than you think.  Support companies that align with your values and beliefs.  I know it's not always possible, but when the opportunity presents itself go ahead and spend the few extra dollars.  Not only are you giving that money to something you believe in but you're also taking it away from something that you don’t.  People are so passionate about certain causes, but when faced with an opportunity to do something about it we often opt for saving a few bucks.  Money drives the world and can be a powerful weapon when used for good.  Gandhi said, _“Action expresses priorities.”_  A lot of times people think awareness is enough but that means nothing without action. _**THANKS SO MUCH TO EVERYONE WHO ENTERED!
