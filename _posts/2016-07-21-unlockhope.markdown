<p><strong>Tell us a little about <a href="https://unlockhope.com/" target="_blank">Unlock Hope</a>-What's the story?</strong><strong>&nbsp;How did it start? What's the mission?</strong></p>
<p>It all started when I watched the documentary <em><a href="http://invisiblechildren.com/" target="_blank">"Invisible Children."</a></em>&nbsp; I&nbsp;was heartbroken by the situation in Uganda and wanted to do something about it.&nbsp; Before seeing the movie, I knew very little about Uganda so&nbsp;I started researching and found the lack of girls'&nbsp;education was a key element in the issues the country is facing.</p>
<p><strong>On the surface our mission is to simply educate girls in Uganda.</strong> And while&nbsp;that's true, it&rsquo;s only one part of what it's about. I am passionate about&nbsp;justice, equality and causing change and there happens to be a big opportunity to&nbsp;further that through educating girls in Uganda. Nelson Mandela described it perfectly when he said, <em>&ldquo;Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your partnership with Think Humanity... How have you seen this partnership succeed?&nbsp;How did you find Think Humanity, and decide to partner with them?</strong></p>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.thinkhumanity.org/" target="_blank">Think Humanity</a> through researching ways to make a difference in Uganda.&nbsp; I was immediately drawn to the fact that they were a small, efficient organization.&nbsp; It is run by a small group of volunteers and a shocking 99% of donations are used directly to fund their programs.&nbsp; They had just started a hostel program where they took in 30 refugee girls and provided them with a safe place to live, nutritious meals, health care and, most importantly, access to quality education.&nbsp; <strong><em>This is the same program that we now fully fund through the sale of our products</em>.</strong>&nbsp; I do what I do best (marketing, sales, product design) and they do what they do best (taking great care of the girls in Uganda).&nbsp; The key to any&nbsp;successful partnership is to allow that to happen without getting in&nbsp;the way of the other.</p>

<p>While the obvious benefits such as access to fresh healthy food, shelter,&nbsp;safety, and healthcare can be seen on a daily basis,&nbsp;the greatest success hasn't yet been realized.&nbsp;<strong> The impact of educating these girls will be felt&nbsp;for generations.</strong>&nbsp; There is an African proverb that says <em>&ldquo;When you educate a girl, you educate a nation.&rdquo;<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6190" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4641.jpg" alt="Unlock Hope for Yellow Co. Blog" width="700" height="700" /></a></em><strong>What were some hurdles you overcame in building a do-good business?</strong></p>
<p>Early on the biggest hurdle was skepticism but lately the biggest hurdle is competition.&nbsp; Or at least the idea of it.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are so many great causes out there and it's okay to support them all.&nbsp;At events people will often will say things like <em>"this is amazing but&nbsp;I support this other organization"</em> or <em>"our church supports this&nbsp;mission so we give all of our money to that."</em>&nbsp; Just because you&nbsp;support one thing doesn't mean you can't support another if it&rsquo;s a cause that you believe in.&nbsp; There's no&nbsp;such thing as doing too much good.</p>
<p><strong>How did you decide to pursue building a social-good business?<br />
</strong><br />
My absolute favorite quote is by Howard Thurman:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go&nbsp;do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.&rdquo; <strong>(Side note from Yellow Co.: Hey! Ours too!)</strong></em></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t even set out to build a business at all.&nbsp; I just wanted to make a difference and I ended up finding a way to make it easy for other people to get involved and make a difference.&nbsp; Up until a year ago I had another business that I worked on in addition to doing this.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel&nbsp;truly passionate about something, then you don't really have a choice&nbsp;but to pursue it and throw yourself into it.&nbsp; I couldn't imagine putting this much effort into&nbsp;something that I wasn't passionate about.&nbsp; Find something that makes&nbsp;you "come alive" and that in itself is "social-good." &nbsp;Most of the&nbsp;problems in the world could be solved simply by people deciding to do&nbsp;what they are passionate about and were created to do.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Did you ever have a different dream or was it always to do what you are doing now?<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I've had a business of some sort ever since I was 14.&nbsp; I would have&nbsp;never guessed that I would be doing this 10 years ago and I don't&nbsp;expect to be doing the same thing&nbsp;<span data-term="goog_1523093060">10 years from now</span>.&nbsp; My dream has&nbsp;always been to do something that I love and to make a difference.&nbsp; That has taken many different forms over the years. &nbsp;I&nbsp;have so many interests and passions and always have an idea in the&nbsp;works for the next thing.<a style="color: #000000;" href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4687.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6191" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_4687.jpg" alt="Unlock Hope for Yellow Co. Blog" width="700" height="700" /></a><strong>What does VALOR mean to you and how do you implement it into your business?<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Most people think of valor as courage but it really has more to do&nbsp;with worth.&nbsp; To me valor is simply having the audacity to be your true&nbsp;self.&nbsp; You don't have to be "this" or "that".&nbsp; You were created to be&nbsp;"other." &nbsp;Your uniqueness is where you will find your worth.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;see it as something to be implemented only in business but as something to&nbsp;be embodied in all aspects of life.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any advice for our readers?</strong></p>
<p><em>Vote with your dollars.</em>&nbsp; You do this multiple times a day whether you&nbsp;realize it or not. It's one of the best ways to truly create&nbsp;change.&nbsp; You have more power than you think.&nbsp; Support companies that align with your values and beliefs.&nbsp; I&nbsp;know it's not always possible, but when the opportunity presents itself&nbsp;go ahead and spend the few extra dollars.&nbsp; Not only are you giving&nbsp;that money to something you believe in but you're also taking it away from&nbsp;something that you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; People are so passionate about certain causes, but when faced with an opportunity to do something about it we often opt&nbsp;for saving a few bucks.&nbsp; Money drives the world and can be a powerful weapon when used for good.&nbsp; Gandhi said, <em>&ldquo;Action expresses priorities.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp; A lot of times people think awareness is enough but that means nothing without action.</p>
