<h2><em>PLUS...WIN $100 TO KROCHET KIDS, A TICKET TO YELLOW AAAND A SURPRISE GIFT WORTH $100! &nbsp;// Update: Giveaway closed, winner has been notified and chosen!</em></h2><br />
<em><a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/" target="_blank">Krochet Kids intl.</a> is a lifestyle brand as well as an innovative non-profit empowering women in Uganda and Peru. In effort to bridge the gap between our clothing and the individuals creating them, every product they make is hand-signed by the woman who made it, and you can even leave her a<a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/what-we-do/meet-the-ladies/" target="_blank"> message of gratitude</a> on their website!&nbsp;Every product represents a path toward self-sufficiency for a lady in <a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/what-we-do/our-impact/" target="_blank">Uganda or Peru</a>, and in addition to consistent employment, the organization also provides mentorship and education.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spring2016pike.jpg"><br />
</a></em></p>
<p>We asked KK Intl. Co-Founder Kohl Crecelius to give us any&nbsp;advice and encouragement he has&nbsp;for&nbsp;entrepreneurs who want to make a difference in the world. He narrowed it down to three things. Read on and get ready to be encouraged!</p>
<h2><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/KROCHET-KIDS-BLOG-IMAGE-NEW1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6453" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/KROCHET-KIDS-BLOG-IMAGE-NEW1.jpg" alt="KROCHET KIDS BLOG IMAGE-NEW" width="700" height="1033" /></a></h2><br />
<strong>Setting out on a path to make an impact in this world is a daunting process.</strong></p>
<p>It will absolutely require an abundant amount of optimism and idealism. This is a good thing, as I believe one of the most important attributes to getting a social project or organization up and running is simply believing that you are capable of doing so.</p>
<h2><em>Thus, my first encouragement&hellip;</em></h2></p>
<h2><strong>GET STARTED.<em><br />
</em></strong></h2><br />
As you get going, you will inevitably be challenged in your thinking, your model and the impact you are creating.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Your aspirations to &ldquo;change the world&rdquo; will most likely feel squelched, due in large part by the people questioning your reach and you doubting your own accomplishments.&nbsp; First and foremost, this is completely normal.&nbsp; <em><strong>YOU ARE NOT ALONE.&nbsp;</strong></em> There were many times throughout our growth at <a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/" target="_blank">KK intl.</a> that we were made to feel bad about not doing &ldquo;enough;&rdquo; not helping enough people, not selling enough products, not serving in enough communities globally.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6311 size-full" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/spring2016pike.jpg" alt="Krochet Kids Intl.'s Kohl Crecelius on THE IDEALIST JOURNEY - Plus another Giveaway!" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<h2><em><strong>My next encouragement&hellip; </strong></em></h2></p>
<h2><strong>KEEP GOING.</strong></h2><br />
There comes a point when you realize the most important lesson you can learn on this journey &mdash; <strong>it&rsquo;s not your job to save the world. </strong>This&nbsp;deserves repeating&hellip;<em><strong>It is not your job to save the world.</strong>&nbsp;</em> While we set out with extremely grand aspirations for leaving a positive mark on the world, the greatest realization we can have is that the only way our world changes in significant and meaningful ways is if <em>every</em> person contributes. <strong>The world needs you to do what you are great at, in order to pursue what you are absolutely passionate about in a way that serves and cares for others.</strong></p>
<h2><em><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/knowwhomadeit4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6312 size-full" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/knowwhomadeit2.jpg" alt="Krochet Kids Intl.'s Kohl Crecelius on THE IDEALIST JOURNEY - Plus another Giveaway!" width="700" height="467" /><br />
</a></strong>This brings me to my last piece of encouragement&hellip; </em></h2></p>
<h2>ENCOURAGE OTHERS.</h2><br />
As I mentioned, I can remember numerous occasions when I was made to feel bad about not doing enough for the world.&nbsp; Then I realized something: <strong>the people who were questioning our reach or impact weren&rsquo;t doing anything themselves!&nbsp;</strong> My response quickly turned into an encouragement to others to help them realize that <a href="http://www.krochetkids.org/" target="_blank">KK intl.</a> isn&rsquo;t here to solve the world's problems.&nbsp; We are great at empowering women in Uganda and Peru through the creation of our lifestyle apparel.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BELIEVE-YOU-ARE-CAPABLE-QUOTE-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6460" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BELIEVE-YOU-ARE-CAPABLE-QUOTE-2.jpg" alt="BELIEVE YOU ARE CAPABLE QUOTE 2" width="700" height="317" /></a><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/knowwhomadeit2.jpg"><br />
</a>I believe the result of this journey &mdash; <strong>GET STARTED, KEEP GOING, ENCOURAGE OTHERS</strong> &mdash; is a newfound sense of what idealism means.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an outlook which sees our specific impact (or project) as a small but important piece in making our world better, but that we stand shoulder to shoulder with many others.</p>
<p>We need each other.&nbsp; It takes us all to change the world.</p>
<p><em><strong>Thanks so much Kohl!</strong></em></p>
