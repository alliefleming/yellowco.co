<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-49.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7416" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-49.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-49" width="700" height="467" /></a><em><strong>This year has been one of chaos, of change, of newness. I graduated college. Got engaged. New Job. Moved. Marriage. Bliss. Chaos. </strong></em></span></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the beauty and the gift that change is, I&rsquo;m never prepared for the grief that it&rsquo;s paired with. </span><b>Transition melts you and reforms you</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to where you feel like a piece of playdough that a 3-year old pancake-smashed, mixed with other colors, and stuck on the bottom of a desk. I almost don&rsquo;t recognize myself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, a friend said a picture of me came to her mind--She saw me running as a young girl through the streets of the town where I grew up. I wasn&rsquo;t running from anything, just running simply because I could run. She said I was marked by a free spirit, uninhibited by the rules of perfection and performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said I&rsquo;ve lost that, and I miss myself...I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it feels like to be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">full,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to not limit myself to the mold that I&rsquo;m expected to fit into, or limit myself to the </span><b>words that I&rsquo;ve begun to describe myself by: </b><b><i>Wife. Employee. Machine. Tired. Incapable. Not. Good. Enough.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve laid out high expectations for myself, ones that I could never achieve without wearing myself down to dust.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-69.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7419" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-69.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-69" width="700" height="467" /></a> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If our house isn&rsquo;t speck free. If our fridge isn&rsquo;t full. If our lunches aren&rsquo;t prepped. If the bed isn&rsquo;t made, I&rsquo;m defeated. I question my worth. </span></p>
<p><b>How is it that I&rsquo;ve even begun to define myself by the state of our dirty laundry? </b></p>
<p><b>As I begin to re-discover the parts of myself that have been choked, I recently began creating space in my weekly rhythm to explore things that fill me. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started painting again, one of the things I spent most of my time doing in high school. It was one of those things that really mattered to me that was the first to go when &lsquo;life&rsquo; got in the way. I hate that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warm, 11a.m. sun bleeding into our 600 square foot studio, bare feet, and hair in a top bun, my paint brush grazed the bare canvas and I immediately stepped back. What was I doing? I didn&rsquo;t have a plan for this painting. I had no vision for the final piece, much less a plan to execute it effectively.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept going, and I let myself have so much fun with it. There was no formula I was trying to follow. You know how often I was told as a kid to stay in the lines? </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Screw it.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-70.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7418" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-70.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-70" width="700" height="467" /></a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That canvas that day taught me </span><b>the three most important things I needed to know about surrendering myself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a way that leaves ample space for freedom. After all, the literal definition of surrender is to cease resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b> A painting is never perfect. Stop striving for perfection. </b></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I won&rsquo;t ever be done. I won&rsquo;t ever be able to apply twelve point font and one inch margins, double check for spelling and grammar, and submit myself to be graded. Trying &ldquo;arrive&rdquo; is mentally, physically, and emotionally draining. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> A painting adds life and character to a space. Stop trying to be someone else.</b></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If my canvas looked like the one on the wall of my favorite coffee shop, there would be one too many. I need to add my own life and character to the places you find myself in. If I find myself in places where I can&rsquo;t do that, then I probably shouldn&rsquo;t stay there.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> A painting is a process. Step back once in awhile, refocus, and remember why you started.</b></li><br />
</ol><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Halfway through my painting I had to go take a walk. My eyes were dry and sandy with frustration. When I came back I had new eyes and a new excitement for where the painting was headed. Step back once in awhile, refocus, and remember why you started.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ValerieDenisePhotos-50.jpg"><br />
</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, my new words for myself as I began to run through the streets again and regain freedom? </span><b><i>Messy. Passionate. Strong. Imperfect. Not. Yet. Finished</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
