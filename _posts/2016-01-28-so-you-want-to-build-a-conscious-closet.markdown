In doing so, I have decided to only purchase clothing if I know it was made without slave labor. It has been a challenging but rewarding experience transitioning my closet to a totally conscious one. One thing I&rsquo;ve learned throughout this process is that it takes time. And patience. And money. So one of the mantra&rsquo;s I have adopted in my closet clean-out over the past two years is to <em>buy better not more.</em> That has served me well.</p>
<p>I get quite a few questions from women about how they can start their own transition to a more ethical closet. So as we start the new year, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of my favorite core pieces and how I choose to add a piece to my closet.</p>
<h2>First of all, I don&rsquo;t have a large, endless clothing budget, so I have to buy smart. When I make purchases I always ask myself these questions:</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Will this dress/sweater/top/etc. bring me joy?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>How versatile is it?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>How do I care for it?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>Can this piece transition from cooler weather to warmer weather?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>Can I layer it and wear it different ways?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>What is the fabric like?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>Is it durable?</h4><br />
</li><br />
</ul><br />
And most importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>How was it made?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>Who made it?</h4><br />
</li></p>
<li>
<h4>Where did the fabric come from?</h4><br />
</li><br />
</ul><br />

Cleaning out your closet is a long process. So give yourself patience!</p>
<p>Here are a few pieces that have been core for me in re-building my conscious closet. My hope is it will kickstart you on your own conscious closets journey and give you a good foundation from which to grow.</p>
<h4>Jeans:</h4><br />
I love a good well made dark jean that can be worn a million different ways (T<a href="http://www.paige.com/hoxton-ankle-peg-barnette/d/400003725C6930?CategoryId=253">he Paige Denim, Hoxton Ankle Peg Jeans in Barnett</a>)</p>
<h4>Black Pants:</h4><br />
Black pants are a must to change up your look and they can be fancy or casual depending on what you pair with it (<a href="https://imogeneandwillie.com/elizabeth-black">Imogene+Willie, Elizabeth Jean in Black</a>)</p>
<h4>Cozy Sweater:</h4><br />
I&rsquo;m all about kimonos and cardigans (<a href="http://elizabethsuzann.com/collections/outerwear/products/jane-kimono?variant=5829770051">Elizabeth Suzann kimono</a>) (<a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=8993&amp;vid=1&amp;pid=517240022">Gap Cable Knit Cardigan</a>)</p>
<h4>Cool Dress:</h4><br />
Again, look for a dress that you can wear multiple ways, like over jeans, or a button down, or with a sweater or blazer (<a href="http://louponline.com/collections/dresses/products/black-gwen-dress">Loup black dress</a>)</p>
<h4>A Good Button Down:</h4><br />
(<a href="https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-tops/products/womens-poplin-long-sleeve-white">Everlane white poplin</a>) Always a great easy piece to keep in your closet</p>
<h4>Something with stripes:</h4><br />
(<a href="https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-all/products/womens-boxy-striped-black-white" target="_blank">Everlane stripe boxy tee</a>) To keep you on trend</p>
<h4>Cool Shoes:</h4><br />
(<a href="http://www.modernvice.com/collections/handlers" target="_blank">Modern Vice Blue Suede Handlers</a>) Because I dress very simply and monochromatic, I love a cool shoe. And the comfier the better.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/static1.squarespace.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/static1.squarespace.jpg" alt="static1.squarespace" width="700" height="1050" /></a>These are pieces that I consistently love and come back to. They form the basis of my closet and most everything I purchase now works with these main items.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you are a fashionista on a budget, check out Tradesy.com or Ebay for awesome finds at a much cheaper price. I do a lot of my conscious shopping at thrift stores. And lookout for sales! I got my modern vice booties (pictured above) for half price!</p>
<p><em>I wish you all the best in 2016 and can&rsquo;t wait to see the conscious closets transitions you make this year.
