<p>The end of the month is coming up quick- which means one thing: Yellow Conference is almost upon us ladies! We are busy getting ready for the big event.</p>
<p>There are just a few tickets left for the conference- which we are very excited about! If you haven't bought yours, <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/the-yellow-conference" target="_blank">don't wait</a>- they will be sold out soon!</p>
<p>For those of you who didn't see our announcement on <a href="http://instagram.com/yellowconference" target="_blank">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/yellowconf" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, we have added <a dir="ltr" href="http://caitlincrosby.com/" target="_blank">Caitlin Crosby</a>&nbsp;to our line up of amazing speakers. Pretty excited about it.</p>
<p>If you are attending The Yellow Conference this year, we have started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/674130756001303/" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a> for you all to communicate about travel plans, rooming together, creative questions, encouragement, etc. Really just for us all to get a bit aquatinted before we hang out for a whole weekend. You can join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/674130756001303/" target="_blank">group here</a>. (and please, if you are not attending the conference, we are trying to keep this page for ticket holders! Thank you!)</p>
<p>Ok!! I think that's it people! Is anyone as ready for the weekend as us?? Make it a good one ladies- don't forget to #bloomyellow :)</p>
