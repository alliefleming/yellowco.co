The end of the month is coming up quick- which means one thing: Yellow Conference is almost upon us ladies! We are busy getting ready for the big event.

There are just a few tickets left for the conference- which we are very excited about! If you haven't bought yours, [don't wait](https://ti.to/yellowconference/the-yellow-conference)- they will be sold out soon!

For those of you who didn't see our announcement on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/yellowconference) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yellowconf), we have added [Caitlin Crosby](http://caitlincrosby.com/)Â to our line up of amazing speakers. Pretty excited about it.

If you are attending The Yellow Conference this year, we have started a [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/674130756001303/) for you all to communicate about travel plans, rooming together, creative questions, encouragement, etc. Really just for us all to get a bit aquatinted before we hang out for a whole weekend. You can join the [group here](https://www.facebook.com/groups/674130756001303/). (and please, if you are not attending the conference, we are trying to keep this page for ticket holders! Thank you!)

Ok!! I think that's it people! Is anyone as ready for the weekend as us?? Make it a good one ladies- don't forget to #bloomyellow :)
