<h1></h1><br />
 As 2016 slowly fades away, it causes me to become reflective on this past year. The highs and lows, what I learned, what I succeeded at and what I need to work on improving. </p>
<p><em><strong>One of the major highlights of this year for me was YOU. This community. The genuine passion, the resiliance and the badassery that comes out of this group of women is INTENSE you guys.</strong></em></p>
<p>Intense in the most inspiring way. I'm consistantly humbled and in awe that I have the opportunity to be surrounded by women like you.</p>
<p>The things I've learned from hearing your stories, reading your emails and meeting so many of you at our Yellow Collective gatherings, chatting online and at the Yellow conference- man oh man. I'm left speechless.</p>
<p>So for that- I say thank you. Thank you for reading this blog. Thanks for commenting.&nbsp;Thanks for having a heart that wants to change the world for the better.</p>
<p>Thanks for having the strong spirits that are willing to move forward in the face of major adversity and hardship.</p>
<p><em><strong>I'm here to tell you that it does not go unnoticed. In owning who you are and what you want out of life, you're changing the world. Celebrate that. You're making a difference. And I'm so thankful.</strong></em></p>
<p>Our world needs you. Remember that. Don't stop. Keep going. You're doing a great job despite your imperfections.</p>
<p>Have the BEST Christmas and holiday season. From all of us here at Yellow, WE LOVE YOU!!!</p>
<p> <em>xoxo,</em> </p>
