The time has come my friends, to make things a bit more official around here and expand our team. We
are looking for an [Event Coordinator](http://yellowconference.com/event-coordinator/), a
[Community Cultivator](http://yellowconference.com/community-cultivator/), and an
[intern for our Bloom Gatherings](http://yellowconference.com/bloom-gathering-intern/). (And could
not be more excited about it!!)

Each of these positions are different, but they all fall under the same umbrella- we want to change
the world by empowering women to do the same. The Yellow Conference is a 2-day gathering taking
place August 27th and 28th, 2015\. We are for creative women who want to change the world through
using their gifts, skills and talents. (If you're not familiar with Yellow Conference, check out our
[Day 1](http://yellowconference.com/yellow-conference-2014-recap-day-1/) and
[Day 2](http://yellowconference.com/yellow-conference-2014-recap-day-2/) recaps from 2014.)

[Here is a list](http://yellowconference.com/team-openings/) of what we are looking for, click on
the job title and you will see the detailed description for each position. Ideally we would love it
if you were local to Los Angeles, but if it's the right fit we can make long distance work!

If you think you might be a good fit, apply!

**Application deadline is Saturday, November 7th.** So be sure to get your apps in before then to be
considered.

Can't wait to hear from you!
