##### **HAPPY FRIDAY!**

<div>

_Incase you've missed our recent announcements on the significant events happening with Yellow, here's an update. We want to make sure you're filled in. :)_

On April 2nd, we will be launching a brand new Kickstarter Campaign! (eek!)  
The campaign will be to fund a digital hub for all things Yellow.  
What is a digital hub, you ask?  
In short, it will be a place where our community of women will be able to connect online,  
download resources and take classes relating to different topics on business and life.  
This is a very large undertaking, and we have a big goal.  
We need everyone's help to get this thing funded!

So, to get as many people involved as possible, we are hosting 9  
#bloomtogether launch parties all over the US and Canada.

_**We have 2 main goals when it comes to the #bloomtogether party:**_

_1_ //  To give like-minded women the opportunity to meet in their local communities, making connections with creative women in their area. Our hope is to create a space where new friendships and collaborations can happen.

_2 _//  To get as many eyes as possible on our Kickstarter Campaign. We have a large goal, and we need to get as many people as we can involved!

_3 _//  To have a good time! Life is short, attending #bloomtogether parties are a must. ;)

Check out our existing locations and RSVP [here](http://yellowconference.com/help-us-bloomtogether/), and if you are in West Virginia, we just added a location in [Parkersburg](https://ti.to/yellowconference/bloom-together-parkersburg-wv).
