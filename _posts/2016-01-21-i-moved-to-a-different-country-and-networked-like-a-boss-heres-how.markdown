This news was met with both immense excitement and a bit of trepidation.</p>
<p>Living in the same city for a long amount of time carries with it a sense of comfort: You know all the short cuts when the roads are backed up with traffic, who to call when you need to grab a glass of wine to brainstorm business ideas, where to go when you have to grab that last minute home item for a dinner party.</p>
<h2>While exciting, moving to a city, <em>albeit a whole new country</em>, is a bit intimidating.</h2><br />
I thought a lot about the challenges that were soon to come. What would I do for a living there? Would I continue to blog? Run my freelance business as a wardrobe stylist? Where would I even begin? These were among some of the thoughts that were initially racing through my head. I had feelings of internal nervousness about what moving to Toronto might be like. But despite those initial fears, I mainly viewed this as a new life experience that most didn&rsquo;t get the opportunity to have. So, I wanted to grab it by its coattails and ride it in the most positive way.</p>
<p>After thinking it over during the few rapidly passing weeks left in my current city, I developed a goal:&nbsp;To reach out to as many new people and integrate myself as quickly as I possibly could into my new city. Prior to moving to Toronto, I knew very little about it. Having only visited Vancouver on the west side for three days, there was a lot of ground I needed to cover. I needed to develop some sort of plan to network with strangers.</p>
<h2><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2015-10-19_0037.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4849" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2015-10-19_0037.jpg" alt="Network like a boss||the yellow co. blog" width="700" height="466" /></a>Here's what worked to help me rebuild my network in a whole new city:</h2></p>
<h4><em>Social Media is a powerful tool to Network</em></h4><br />
As a blogger and entrepreneur (freelance stylist), I depend a lot on social media. So when planning the move, I set about using social media as one of my most powerful networking tools. I started on Instagram, researched Google for &ldquo;Toronto style blogs&rdquo; &amp; &ldquo;Toronto food blogs.&rdquo; These were a few of the places I started to explore to find information about my new city. I used relevant hashtags to find people and places. As I researched, I learned that I was already following a few women on social media who were from Toronto! From that point, I created multiple lists of people to reach out to. I made a list for &ldquo;potential collaborations&rdquo;, &ldquo;style bloggers&rdquo; (because I have a style blog myself), &ldquo;food blogs&rdquo;, &ldquo;PR/Media Companies&rdquo;, &ldquo;Brands&rdquo;, &ldquo;job ideas&rdquo;. Then I created a general (<em>but authentic!</em>) email that I tailored to each and every person who was on my lists. I included an introduction, something that I liked/enjoyed about them/their brand/their blog, etc., and I asked them if they wanted to grab coffee. I mean, what did I have to lose? The worst thing that could happen was they could have said no.</p>
<p>But you know what? 90% of them agreed! Some of these ladies have now become part of my new Toronto network. And what a resource they have been! These ladies became the eyes and ears of the city I needed to learn so much about. Social media is a powerful tool that can be used for good when you&rsquo;re developing &amp; building a new network. You have to take that leap and put yourself out there. It was worth the time &amp; effort that I put into sending those emails. These ladies have been one of my most powerful resources. All from social media!</p>
<h4><em>Update Your Media Kit, Resume, and Create a Mini Bio about yourself </em></h4><br />
I knew if I was going to be reaching out to anyone, I needed to brush up on my resume and media kit. So I did just that. I went as far to write a mini bio about myself to give a glimpse of who I was to others. I wrote it all on the website, <a href="http://canva.com" target="_blank">canva.com</a>, which has great pre-created templates to use. I saved those 3 documents to a folder on my desktop and when I sent out emails, I knew exactly what attachments to include! This was great resource when I needed to send my &lsquo;<em>get-to-know-me</em>&rsquo; email and has proven handy in the months following our move.</p>
<h4><em>Reach out to Brands, Businesses, and PR Companies and Introduce Yourself; Offer Content, and/or ask to Intern to get to know the ropes.</em></h4><br />
In addition to reaching out to new blogging friends, as a blogger/entrepreneur one of the most important networking goals for me was letting businesses, brands, and PR/Media know that I was out there and that I was moving to Toronto. I hopped on Twitter and Google and searched&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;PR companies Toronto&rsquo;,</em> <em>&lsquo;Social Media Marketing Companies Toronto&rsquo;,</em>&nbsp;and <em>&lsquo;Local Toronto Brands&rsquo;.</em> I found their contact information and specific names of people <strong>(bonus:&nbsp;<em>it is so important to try and address all emails by first names rather than &ldquo;To Whom It May Concern&rdquo;</em>)</strong> and added them to my networking email list.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2015-10-19_0031.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4847" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2015-10-19_0031.jpg" alt="Network like a boss||the yellow co. blog" width="700" height="466" /></a>I then created a generalized template email that politely introduced myself and gave them a brief story of our move, told them I was interested in collaborating and included my new updated bio &amp; media kit. I made sure to add in a few specific details about them or why I felt I would be a good fit for them. <strong>When networking, it&rsquo;s crucial to highlight something unique about that brand or business that you recognize.</strong> It really helps you to stand out among the plethora of emails they receive daily. Mention a brand they represent or how you can help create a blog post highlighting a product.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>When networking, it&rsquo;s crucial to highlight something unique about that brand or business that you recognize.

As I mentioned, I wasn&rsquo;t sure where I wanted to start when it came to jumping into a job. So in my emails I also mentioned I was available for &ldquo;internships,&rdquo; if needed, to help get to know the industry. When I did this, one new boutique PR agency here in Toronto needed an intern! So I interned with them for a few months, worked on a project, and they got to know who I was. It also helped me to get to know the ins/outs of the city really quickly! Working for this agency also benefitted me because they knew I was also a freelance wardrobe stylist and when they had a styling job opportunity, they asked to hire me! From that one email to a PR agency, I was able to get to know some fabulous ladies, intern, and get hired on a styling job. Reaching out with an authentic email really did the trick! Now we&rsquo;re working together on future opportunities.</p>
<h4><em>Continue to be Authentic and Follow up on Outreach</em></h4><br />
Someone I met in Toronto said to me upon meeting, <em>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the same on social media as you are in person!&rdquo;</em> I took this to be a <strong>very. big. compliment.</strong> Something I want to make sure of when networking online is that I am authentic and intentional. Yes, when I post things, it&rsquo;s bright, shiny, and colorful. But that&rsquo;s how I see the world. And that&rsquo;s how my personality is, too. When posting on social media then reaching out to brands, I try to make sure my true self shines through. If I email someone, I try to make sure there is something unique about them that I point out and I also mention how I think that I align with that aesthetic. If you are being true to you and being authentic, that will allow you to reach out and network with some really amazing people.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Something I want to make sure of when networking online is that I am authentic and intentional. Yes, when I post things, it&rsquo;s bright, shiny, and colorful.

When posting on social media then reaching out to brands, I try to make sure my true self shines through.</em></blockquote><br />
When I do send out an email, meet a brand, or work with media, I always make it a point to send a follow-up email or note. It&rsquo;s especially helpful as a reminder if I haven&rsquo;t heard back from someone. Then when/if I do, I try to take the time to hand-write or email a thank you! <strong>If someone goes out of their way to meet up with you or connect you with someone, it&rsquo;s especially important to give out the Thank You love!</strong> You will be remembered if you follow up; trust me, it makes all the difference.</p>
<p>When we decided to make our big move, there was a certain sense of familiarity that I had to let go of. I had to learn to be a bit more malleable and understand that I couldn&rsquo;t control the outcome of what was to happen. It wasn&rsquo;t easy. But I learned by reaching out into the unfamiliar, offering myself up to exploring new possibilities, being true &amp; authentic, and following up with gratitude, I&rsquo;ve been able to network with amazing new people, make genuine quality friendships, brand partnerships, and am immensely proud of starting anew in our city of Toronto that I now call home.</p>
