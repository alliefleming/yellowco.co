<p>Whimsical, free-spirit, yet full of deep thoughts and creativity...Kathryn Wahl, our eyes behind our <a href="https://instagram.com/yellowconference/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and our voice behind social media, is a true one-of-kind gem, and we are excited to share a little glimpse into her life with you today...</p>
<p>So, without further adieu, ladies and gents, Kathryn Wahl...</p>
<p><em><strong>A note from Kathryn:&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>The day you are about to view is an example of a good one with enough time for coffee, friends, and creativity. Various errands, part-time jobs, and real life inferences are subject to change.</p>

<p><strong>I call this "quiet morning work time." Check emails, write to-do lists, and work on some Yellow while drinking yummy coffee and eating breakfast...</strong></p>

<p><strong>Walk Knik (the handsome husky) and Luna (the radiant rescue pup) around the block...</strong></p>

<p><b>Depending on the day, I might head to an audition. This requires outfits I'd never normally put together, memorizing some lines and jumping face first into the unknown. It also means: quality time with my car and singing (poorly) to music in LA traffic...</b></p>

<p><strong>Meet up with one of my best friends, Amanda, and get some more work done and wedding planning in my planner while Pinterest-searching...</strong></p>

<p><strong>We like to old fashion-ly write things down...</strong></p>

<p><strong>I'm trying to make it to a workout class three times a week...<em>trying.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>If I'm not having some wine time with my fiance or my wonderful roommate, Rachel, I do a little writing and/or reading...</strong></p>
