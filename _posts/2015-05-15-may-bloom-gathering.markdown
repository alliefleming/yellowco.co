I (Joanna) am SUPER excited for our next gathering! We are having Beth Zeigler from The [Bneato Bar](http://bneatobar.com/) lead us through an efficiency workshop.

Beth will be covering the subjects of tackling your inbox, scheduling your day and time management. This workshop is extremely important for creatives as oftentimes we struggle with organization and keeping to a schedule. But the truth is, in order to get things done in the best way possible and make an impact, we have to learn how to be organized and effectively manage our time.

So come learn how! We will be gathering at [West Elm in Santa Monica](http://www.westelm.com/stores/us/ca/santa-monica/) at 7pm on May 28th.

We are also asking that attendees clean out their closets before coming and bring a bag of clothes to donate to the [Downtown Women's Center](http://www.downtownwomenscenter.org/). Get organized while giving back. (For a list of clothing items they are looking for, see the [Women's Center wishlist](http://www.downtownwomenscenter.org/our_wishlist)).

So excited to hang with you and get organized! We have limited amount of spots so grab your ticket [here](https://ti.to/yellowconference/may-bloom-gathering)!
