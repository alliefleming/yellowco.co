<p>Hey loves!</p>
<p>Thank you so much to everyone who has backed our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> and supported us thus far. We are riding this thing out until the end. Right now we are at $15,203 and have 263 backers with 5 days to go.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, we are so thankful and blessed to have raised this much and to have&nbsp;the support that we have.</p>
<p>If you haven't seen it, we have been doing a countdown on our <a href="http://instagram.com/yellowconference" target="_blank">Instagram</a>, asking you questions revolving around business, life, entrepreneurship and spreading good. We want to get to know you better. So hang out with us over there and participate in our q + a :) (PS- did you see that Instagram just gave us the ability to hashtag emogies?? Pretty awesome).</p>
<p>Last night we had our last "Evenings with Yellow"- where we live stream interviewed female creative entrepreneurs and talked a variety of subjects. They have all been recorded and are hanging out on our <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/114908593334625555940/114908593334625555940/posts" target="_blank">Google Plus</a> + <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChB2dF3cDVB4iIqZG023FgA" target="_blank">YouTube</a> pages. Definitely check them out!</p>
<p>We are also doing our last <a href="https://twitter.com/yellowconf" target="_blank">#bloomtogether Twitter party</a> tomorrow night at 7:30pm PST. So hang out with us over there as we talk about focusing on what matters and branding from the heart. All under the #bloomtogether hashtag.</p>
<p>Thank you again for all of your support through April and bearing with us as we have strayed a bit from our regular blogging + social media content to focus on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. We will get back to normal next month!</p>
<p>You are all amazing! Thank you for sticking around here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
