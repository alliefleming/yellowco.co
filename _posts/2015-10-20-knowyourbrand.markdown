BLOG: BRAND YOURSELF" width="700" height="525" /></a>During college, I was always told that each individual has an opportunity to cultivate their own personal brand.</h5><br />
How you present yourself on social media, in your daily lives, and how others perceive you is all part of this &lsquo;brand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Yellow introduced this seasons series, <em><strong>Refine</strong></em>, I was instantly inspired. The definition of &lsquo;Refine&rsquo; as a verb is to become elegant, but it is also to purify. As we enter a new season, purifying the mind and re-centering who each of us are as individuals, and as a collective in our companies/workplaces is so important to making sure that we are aligning with our true selves and values.</p>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">So, let&rsquo;s take things a step further. Before you can present your value or passion to others, it&rsquo;s important to ask </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">yourself</em><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> some defining questions that solidify your direction and journey. More importantly, you need this constant reminder of your &lsquo;WHY&rsquo; to keep you pushing forward.</span></p>
<p>Now keep in mind, I&rsquo;m not talking about your company, or your new venture &shy;&ndash; this is all about YOU. If these answers align with your business, then that&rsquo;s amazing, they should! And if your answers are a little off, try to find small ways to steer them in the right direction.</p>
<h5><strong>Here are 6 questions you should ask yourself to help clarify and define your personal brand:</strong></h5><br />
