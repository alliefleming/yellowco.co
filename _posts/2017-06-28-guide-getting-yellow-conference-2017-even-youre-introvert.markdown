[Yellow Conference 2017](http://yellowco.co/conference/) is just under two months away! This is consistently the highlight of my year. Without even trying, I always adopt do-good habits into my life after being surrounded by a group of women set out to make this world a better place for three days straight.

Being that our conference happens once a year, we thought it would be helpful to put together a 5-step guide to help you get the most out of the 4th Annual [Yellow Conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/).

### 1\. COME WITH AN OPEN HEART AND MIND

Yellow isn't the kind of conference that you go to and exchange a bunch of business cards with others looking to use your services, and then forget about each other. Yellow is the kind of place you go to meet your tribe. The women who understand the calling you have deep within your soul. The ones who nod their heads in agreement when you talk about the big dreams you have for the world. I met four of my now best friends at the very first Yellow Conference in 2014, and every year since then, we've all come together in August for each Yellow since. In order to be able to make friends like this, you've got to come with your guard down. Get vulnerable, don't be afraid to share your heart with others, and be open to letting others in. Be ready to hear soul changing words from both speakers and attendees alike. An open mind and an open heart will help you leave feeling filled up and truly changed for the better.

### 2\. RESEARCH THE SPEAKERS AHEAD OF TIME

It's fun to show up to a conference and discover new speakers and people to follow, but it's even more fun to come and hear from a speaker whose work you've familiarized yourself with. You can check out this year's speakers [right here](http://yellowco.co/yellow-conference-2017-speakers/), and [click on their images](http://yellowco.co/yellow-conference-2017-speakers/) to be brought to their websites. Google their names, follow them on Instagram, and get excited to hear from and possibly meet them at the conference! They are truly making big waves in the world, and you're going to want to connect with them!

### 3\. BECOME A YELLOW COLLECTIVE MEMBER AND ATTEND THE SURROUNDING EVENTS

For the first time ever, we're hosting special events for our [Yellow Collective Members](http://yellowcollective.co/) surrounding the conference. Things like a Soul Cycle class and brunch the day before the conference, a member only lunch happening the first day of the conference, and a Friday night hangout with small bites, drinks, and live music. It's going to be a great time to get some smaller group time (talking to you introverts!) to connect with women from all over the country. You can grab your [Membership](http://yellowcollective.co/) up until Friday of this week. [More info right here](http://yellowcollective.co/). We'd love to have you [join us](http://yellowcollective.co/)!

### 4\. GRAB A WORKSHOP DAY PASS

This is where day 3 comes in! After the main two days of the conference, we offer a smaller, more hands-on workshop experiences for those who want to dive deeper and get to the practical, tangible knowledge needed to change your life, business, and the world. These are meant to give you clear, actionable steps on how to move forward after the inspiration from the conference starts to fade. Workshops are not included in the main Conference Price - each workshop is an extra cost, but _totally_ worth it. We are announcing our workshop leaders and titles next week. If you'd like to be notified when they go on sale, hop on the workshop [email interest list here](http://eepurl.com/cUck21).

### 5\. REMEMBER TO REST!

With everything going on during the three days of the conference, it's important to find time to rest both during and after the conference. The main reason we have the conference happening on a Thursday and Friday is so you can have the weekend to relax, regroup and reflect after the conference is over. Take time to journal your thoughts, write a letter to yourself or just get some sleep to make sure you can retain all of the goodness you just took in.

[Yellow Conference 2017](http://yellowco.co/conference/) is happening August 24th & 25th, with workshops happening on the 26th. If you'd like to join us, [head here to purchase your ticket](http://yellowco.co/conference/) and [click here to grab your membership](http://yellowcollective.co/).
