Their model is currently equipping over 400 mothers in Uganda and Dallas (7 communities in rural Uganda and 2 communities in Dallas) to provide for 3,000 dependents.&nbsp;This Mother&rsquo;s Day, we are proud to be partnering with <a href="http://akolaproject.org/" target="_blank">Akola Project</a> to help spread the word about their mission to empower thousands of women in Uganda and Dallas.</em></h4><br />
<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nali-Bagaga-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5376" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Nali-Bagaga-1.jpg" alt="Nali Bagaga (1)" width="700" height="791" /></a>Nali Bagaga&nbsp;lives in&nbsp;Nabukosi, Eastern Uganda and cares for 10 children and 3 elderly dependents. Nali Bagaga&rsquo;s entire house could fit in a single bedroom here in the U.S. The floors are dirt; the roof, thatched. With one bed against the wall, enclosed by a mosquito net, she would offer up her only chair for you to sit in as she sits on a raffia-braided mat - an honor that she would not let you pass up.</p>
<h2>Yes, her floors are dirt and her roof is thatched but notice the bricks. A luxury she afforded through her work with Akola.</h2><br />
Still, her family&rsquo;s house is not secure and safe.</p>
<p>After one year of working with Akola, she was able to buy a bike to assist her in fetching water;&nbsp;it has drastically reduced the amount of time she has to spend getting water &ndash; from 5 hours a day day to 30 minutes &ndash; allowing her more time to earn income and be with her family.</p>
<p>And, if you were to visit her house, you'd notice a group of sweet kids curiously whispering and giggling in the doorway-watching as you converse with their Mama. Those kids are not all in school. They all have health care. and they all have healthy diets each day.</p>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">A group of Akola members designed and purchased uniforms for themselves. <strong>Those uniforms are a sign of dignity.</strong> She is so so proud that she has a job, that she earning for her family, and she wants everyone to know it.&nbsp;</span></p>

Nali Bagaga is just 1 of 400 women Akola empowers through our social mission.</h2><br />
Living and working on the ground in Uganda, taught the team at Akola that there are <em>thousands</em> of mothers like Nali Bagaga.</p>
<p>Mothers who would forgo eating if their children did not have food.<br />
Mothers who worked any odd job they could find in order to afford the school fees for just one of their children.<br />
Mothers who were having to make the decision about which child would get health care that year because she could not afford it for all of them.<br />
And mothers who were <em>dying</em> giving labor in their mud hut because they had sacrificed their own health care, so more of their children would have coverage.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Wolf_insta7_feb16.jpg"><br />

<p>They are&nbsp;currently equipping over 400 mothers in Uganda and Dallas (7 communities in rural Uganda and 2 communities in Dallas) to provide for 3,000 dependents.&nbsp;Akola products have retailed in over more than 450 specialty and department stores.</p>
<p><strong>The number of women they work with is <em>directly correlated</em> to the number of units they sell. And, because they are a non-profit, <u>100%</u> of the Akola product sales are reinvested in the social mission to empower more women.</strong></p>
<p><em>This Mothers' Day, consider giving a gift that not only makes them feel beautiful, but empowers women like Nali Bagaga. And be sure to use the code <strong>BLOOM30&nbsp;</strong>to receive 30% off your order! This code is available through Mother's Day (May 8th).&nbsp;</em></p>
