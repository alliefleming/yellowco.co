</a>A truly productive day seems to be the long sought-after and oft-elusive goal of businesswomen, moms, and just generally, humans everywhere&nbsp;<em>(Please tell me it&rsquo;s not just me!).</em> It&rsquo;s a state that&rsquo;s considerably important in my own life; so much so that I&rsquo;ve devoted my life&rsquo;s work to creating products that help people gain control of the day-to-day &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; in their lives. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><em>It&rsquo;s a state that&rsquo;s considerably important in my own life; so much so that I&rsquo;ve devoted my life&rsquo;s work to creating products that help people gain control of the day-to-day &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; in their lives.</em></blockquote><br />
But I don&rsquo;t claim to be perfect at it. I have days where nothing seems to get done, and projects where I have to request an extended deadline. There are often moments where I feel that I am failing at something or letting someone down. Still, I press on in pursuit of the secret to true productivity. Because I&rsquo;ve realized that being productive isn&rsquo;t about being perfect, it&rsquo;s about prioritization and it&rsquo;s about practice.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few of the practices that have helped me get as close to perfect productivity as possible:</span></h2></p>
<h4><b>Review the Big Picture Plan</b></h4><br />
There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about resolutions recently for obvious reasons (happy new year!). Whether you&rsquo;re setting resolutions, intentions, goals, or just generally designing your life based on how you want to live and feel, the desired end result is the same: to live our lives better, as the best version of ourselves, as often as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>I&rsquo;ve realized that being productive isn&rsquo;t about being perfect, it&rsquo;s about prioritization and it&rsquo;s about practice.</em></blockquote><br />
With that in mind, I think it&rsquo;s important to review this big picture life plan (or your goals or resolutions or core desired feelings) often. Don&rsquo;t just make a list at the beginning of the year or the beginning of the month or even the beginning of the week... and then forget about it. Our days&mdash;and the activities and people we fill them with&mdash;make up our weeks and our months and our years. It sounds obvious, but I think we seldom reflect on that when we&rsquo;re mired in the day-to-day minutiae.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you review the big picture plan for this year (or for your life), ask yourself: <strong><em>How does today&rsquo;s to-do list get me closer to the life I want to live?</em></strong> Make sure you&rsquo;re always viewing your day through that lens, so you&rsquo;re clear on what you need to prioritize to get you closer to that ideal.</span></p>
<h4><b>Plan Your Day the Day Before</b></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn&rsquo;t really matter how you do this&mdash;you might use an online calendar (like Google Calendar) or a paper planner (like <a href="http://shop.daydesigner.com/" target="_blank">the Day Designer</a>, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ahem</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">), or even just a simple sheet of notebook paper. And you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to plan exactly one day before. It could be two days before or on the Sunday evening before the week begins...just make sure you&rsquo;re planning your day before it arrives.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Why is this so important?</strong></em> Because I guarantee you that when you sit down to write your to-do list on the day you have things to do, you&rsquo;ll immediately hear the siren song of unanswered emails and unfed children clamoring for your attention and focus.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people like to list every single thing they need to get done in the day; others like to separate work tasks from personal tasks. Some people schedule an exact time and place for every task; others are content to just list their priorities and allow for them to get done when they get done. Don&rsquo;t put too much time and energy into the how or the when&mdash;just make sure that you do it, and do it in a way that works best for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you start your day with a plan, you&rsquo;re much more likely to do those things you&rsquo;ve prioritized for the day, instead of letting yourself be pulled by the tide of other people&rsquo;s expectations and &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo;.</span></p>
<h4><b>Do the Most Important Work First + Do the Hardest Work Next</b></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After you&rsquo;ve listed everything you need to do in a given day, consider the hierarchy of your tasks. This is important because most of us, if given the opportunity, will start our days with whatever is easiest&mdash;like rolling over in bed, grabbing our phones, and immediately scrolling through and answering emails (orrrrr scrolling through Instagram). Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but this is likely not the most important work you have to do on any given day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Start with the important work first, then move on to the hardest task</strong>&mdash;these might even be one and the same. Brian Tracy has a great book called <em>&ldquo;Eat That Frog!&rdquo;,</em> which highlights this principle beautifully. The idea is that once you&rsquo;re done with the important and difficult work&mdash;once you&rsquo;ve <em>eaten the frog,</em> in other words&mdash;you&rsquo;ll feel accomplished and productive (and likely more inspired to knock out the rest of your to-do list!) no matter what else gets done throughout the day.</span></p>
<h4><b>Make Your Not-To-Do List</b></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be protective of your time, because I promise you, very few other people or situations will be. Now that you&rsquo;ve planned what you need and want to do on a given day, plan what you will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> do. What are the people or activities or &ldquo;to-dos&rdquo; you can let go of (even if only for the moment) so that you can prioritize and focus on the work that you must do? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know this seems silly or potentially unnecessary, but I encourage you to actually write out this list, too&mdash;make it very clear what you will </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be doing to make room for what you will do. Then, when those people or situations or &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo; (hint: these are not actual emergencies, just situations that seem as if they are) pop up, you&rsquo;ll already know the answer: NO.</span></p>
<h4><b>Give Yourself Grace</b></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This might be my favorite tip, no matter the topic: <strong><em>Please</em></strong> give yourself grace. It&rsquo;s not all going to get done. That&rsquo;s just the reality of life. And the sooner we can accept that and give ourselves the leeway to have good and bad days&mdash;days where we strike-through every item on the list and days where we crawl back into bed around 11am&mdash;the better we&rsquo;ll get at identifying and doing what&rsquo;s most important. And isn&rsquo;t that the ultimate goal of productivity, anyways?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfectly productive day might still be a unicorn&mdash;at least, for my sake, I hope it is&mdash;but I hope you&rsquo;ll find these tips helpful as you design the day that lets you live (and love) the life you&rsquo;ve planned.</span></p>
