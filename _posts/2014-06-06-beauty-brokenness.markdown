I was floored, drawn to tears and completely inspired after watching this [Creative Mornings](http://creativemornings.com/) video. [Ruthie Lindsey](http://www.ruthielindsey.com/) is an interior designer and stylist who does so much more than make things look pretty. Ruthie has experienced some major life changing hardships. Where most people would crumble and become hard towards the world, but Ruthie has chosen to have beauty to spill out of the broken pieces in her life, causing her to be an extremely empathetic, whole-hearted individual who happens to also be an extremely talented [interior designer and stylist](http://www.ruthielindsey.com/work/). (Her [Instagram](http://instagram.com/ruthielindsey) is something magical!)

If you watch one video this weekend, definitely watch this one.
