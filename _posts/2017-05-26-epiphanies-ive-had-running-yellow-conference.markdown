Happy Friday ladies! My name is Joanna Waterfall, and I'm the Founder of Yellow Co. I started Yellow by putting on a [conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/) in 2014, and this August we will be holding our [4th annual Yellow Conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/). In my three years of running Yellow, I've had the opportunity to meet and get to know so many inspiring women from all over the world. I've been empowered by them, I've learned about myself through them, and along the way have had some major, life changing realizations I want to let you in on.

### 1\. WOMEN ARE CHANGING THE WORLD THROUGH BUSINESS

<div>

A 2015 study showed that the global social entrepreneurship space is made up of 55% men and 45% women. A much smaller gap when compared to the commercial space of business. My guess is that it will be an even smaller gap in 2017. **Men and women are equally represented in the social enterprise space** - _how cool is that?_ This is proof that women are running towards the space of social good and entrepreneurship.

As women, we've come so far, haven't we? Less than 100 years ago we didn't even have the right to vote, and now we're running for president, starting companies, and building empires. It's awesome. Although we still have a ways to go, and at times it can feel like a _really_ long way, we have to recognize that women are literally changing the world through the businesses and initiatives they've started. I've been so inspired by having the opportunity to witness this first hand through my work with Yellow.

### 2\. YOU'RE NEVER DONE LEARNING

It's pretty easy to get a big head in business. When something goes right, you're stoked. Another thing goes right, and you gain confidence. Then _another_ thing goes right, and you feel like you could conquer the world. At this point, it's easy to think that whatever you touch will turn to gold. This happens a lot at the beginning phases of business. Beginners luck, you could say.

<div>

This is what happened to me. Our first [Yellow Conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/) sold out and was a huge success in 2014\. And after that, I thought I could take on anything. I crafted the idea that since I had done one conference well, I had the second one in the bag. _Wrong._

Through making many mistakes and being so comfortable that details fell through the cracks, I quickly learned that I couldn't approach our second conference the same way as the first. Since then, I try to see every year of the [Yellow Conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/) as if it were the very first. It keeps me on my toes and my mind fresh.

I will never be done learning, and that's okay. Because the minute you are done learning is the minute your business suffers. Work will change, but it never ends. Some problems will be solved, but there will always be new ones. You will reach certain goals, but there will be new challenges to overcome. **The key is to enjoy the journey, embrace the process, and never get too comfortable.**

### 3\. THE WORLD NEEDS WOMEN TO COME TOGETHER FOR GOOD

<div>

Powerful things happen when women come together - I've seen it first hand. From the Women's March, to women's conferences all over the world, I have seen women waking up to the realization that in order for things to change, we must work together. Collaborate instead of compete. See "her success as my success".

In the 19th Century, philosopher and poet Matthew Arnold wrote these words:

### _“If ever there comes a time when the women of the world come together purely and simply for the benefit of mankind, it will be a force such as the world has never known.”_

_Can you even with that quote?_

Through my work with Yellow, I've realized the power that exists when women come together for a cause greater than themselves. I have seen a wave of women who have a deep desire to make this world a better place rise up and begin taking action in solving the world's deepest and most difficult problems. Women are suffering and sacrificing for the sake of others and to further the greater good.

Could it be that we are approaching the era that Matthew Arnold talked about? I believe we are. As women, we have a unique power to bring to the world. We are empathetic, nurturing, and we know how to make things happen. **When we work together and collectively bring our gifts, skills, and talents to the table, free from fear, mountains can be moved.**

Throughout history, the voice of women has been silenced. But now, we have entered a time when we as women have more speaking power than we ever have before, _and we're using it for good_. We are speaking up for our global sisters who do not have the same platforms we do. We are fighting for the world's most vulnerable. Being loud for those who have been silenced. Standing up for our rights by the millions. Ladies, we are showing up. And when we continue to work together for the good of mankind, when we focus on elevating those around us instead of ourselves, we will be, and ARE, a force to be reckoned with.
