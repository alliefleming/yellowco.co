This year we had the pleasure of hosting an intimate dinner at Hudson Loft the night before the conference. It was a special evening where some of the kindest souls gathered together in one room to converse, drink yummy wine and eat good food.

[West Elm Santa Monica](https://www.facebook.com/westelmsantamonica) let us use their beautiful decor for the event. Their furniture, blankets, table settings and adorable pillows were perfect in making this Downtown LA loft cozy and inviting.

[Heirloom Design House](http://www.heirloomdesignhouse.com/) provided the florals for the night. The wildflowers paired with palm leaves and greenery were the perfect accents to soften up the space.

[Union Wine](http://unionwinecompany.com/) kept the laughs rolling throughout the night. I've become such a huge fan of this brand. They're all about keeping things simple, not making wine too fancy, and keeping those "pinkies down". They even have [wine that comes in a can](http://shop.unionwinecompany.com/collections/underwood/products/underwood-pinot-in-a-can), which we gifted to each of our speakers. How perfect would that be for an outdoor picnic? Kat from [Little Cat Design Co](https://instagram.com/littlecatdesignco/). made all of these amazing signs throughout the room to highlight our vendors. She designs them and cuts them herself! What a gem.  
[![Music](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/09/Music1.jpg)](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/09/Music1.jpg)  
We kept the decor simple and let the atmosphere speak for itself. There was live music, and as the sun began to set over the LA skyline, we sat down to a gorgeous meal.

Everyone went around the table and introduced themselves. You guys, these people are all complete gems. They're kicking booty in the world and doing it for good. What an honor to sit and eat with these powerhouse world changers.
