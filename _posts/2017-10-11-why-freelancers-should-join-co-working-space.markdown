<h3>There is a place where everybody knows my name.</h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The <em>Cheers</em>&nbsp;dream is real. There are overflowing draft beverages (consisting of kombucha and drip coffee), and an ergonomic chair beckoning me to sit that adjusts perfectly to my 5&rsquo;10&rdquo; frame. There are regulars, intriguing new people coming in and out, and the most incredible team&nbsp;running the place that know just what I like.&nbsp;Co-working, you&rsquo;re my muse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My co-working space is my <em>Cheers</em>. It&rsquo;s there for me always, but not in an overbearing way like an office is. I even have co-workers, thank goodness. I was becoming a complete societal liability as a work from home shut-in. My co-workers are the best kind of people - they&rsquo;re as driven as I am, they &ldquo;get me&rdquo;, and they don&rsquo;t play office politics. They do, however, chat beside the water cooler, celebrate big occasions, and high-five me if the moment really beckons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel like I hit the co-working jackpot with my space, <a href="https://fldwrk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FLDWRK</a>. But in all reality, there are many of these freelance and solopreneur meccas popping up. I sought out&nbsp;FLDWRK when my business was just barely making it, but working from home was starting to break me.</span></p>

<h3><strong> I figured it was worth the investment in my sanity, even if my business&nbsp;proved unsustainable.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Within one month, my productivity skyrocketed. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-working model was&hellip; working. What happened was not revolutionary, but was beautifully designed to deliberately fill that gap between nine to five full-timer and on-your-owner. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-working is&nbsp;a great solution because it creates a dedicated space to work, be creative, and set aside any distraction. There&rsquo;s the perfect amount of ambient noise, and background music set at a researched volume&nbsp;most conducive for productivity. Of course, there are resources like wi-fi, printers, scratch paper, and mail services. But one of the best benefits is this buzz of human life around you marked by self-motivation and pursuing a common goal.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With my co-working space, FLDWRK, I found a place that was uniquely fit for my particular business - one that was defined by social good and double bottom line purpose. I actually couldn&rsquo;t believe a place existed that spoke so squarely to me and my business, but that is part of the co-working gig.&nbsp;A space can be perfectly suited for your mission and purpose, therefore making the&nbsp;others there the perfect co-workers for you too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-working model is not just about being an open space that houses the creative entrepreneurs of the world. It has its own business with a mission and purpose too. At FLDWRK, they are working to build stronger and better communities. They run many workshops, facilitate leadership and coaching groups, and launch their own start-ups with an incubator - all for businesses that pursue a deeper social benefit. </span></p>
<h3><strong>It&rsquo;s about more than just a desk you can go to - it allows those of us mad enough to chase the wild passions we have do so in a space designed and meant for us. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s about support and drip coffee, and people knowing and loving what you do, whether you 'make it' or not. It&rsquo;s about cultivating that pursuit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an era where freelancing and side gigging is becoming an overwhelming norm, I bet we&rsquo;ll see more of these brilliant hives pop up, nurturing all the people buzzing around with their dreams. I for one have seen my business and personal identity as an entrepreneur thrive within a co-working space, and highly recommend you find your <em>Cheers</em>&nbsp;of a&nbsp;work home - it&rsquo;s out there! </span></p>
