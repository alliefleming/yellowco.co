<p>Working <a href="http://harbr.co/" target="_blank">in the creative industry</a>, I&rsquo;ve seen all types of workers and workspaces. Cluttered desks, inspiration hoarders (guilty), scatter-brained, and the work-a-holics. There is beauty in all of these workflows,&nbsp;but it&rsquo;s easy to lose track of tasks&nbsp;that&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;be completed to help grow your business or maintain relationships.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <strong>creatives can&nbsp;be organized&nbsp;while still producing their amazing ideas or products.</strong> All it takes is a little mind-training to get the important stuff out of the way before you drift off to dream land and conquer those big ideas.</p>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t classify myself as a designer, developer&nbsp;or photographer&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;I am a project manager by day, so organization is a must for me. Calendars, to-do lists and apps have changed my life, so I&rsquo;m going to share a few ways I stay organized while working in the creative industry.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>BLOCK YOUR TIME</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
Set an hour for emails, a&nbsp;time for design, or&nbsp;a day for meetings. Look at your week on a large scale and see what you&rsquo;re always forgetting or find yourself scrambling to complete&nbsp;at the end of each day.</p>
<p>Time-tracking can definitely be a chore in itself, but as a test, take one week and time yourself on how long it takes to do specific items.</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s client work, blogging, or answering emails, you don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time&nbsp;on one task, or your brain will be too fried to tackle anything else. Once you have a grasp on the amount of hours it takes to do items you need to do each&nbsp;week,&nbsp;block that time out of each day and&nbsp;you&rsquo;ll be done before you know it.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/094A4189-1.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-2371 aligncenter" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/094A4189-1.jpg" alt="Being a Productive Creative" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p>As an example, for my job, we set a specific day to&nbsp;schedule phone meetings.&nbsp;I also spend&nbsp;two&nbsp;hours each day strictly answering and sending emails.&nbsp;One in the morning and one in the afternoon. If urgent emails come up throughout the day, of course those are tackled, but I have to make sure my other tasks are not overlooked.</p>
<p>Blocking time helps&nbsp;compartmentalize your tasks that way you can&nbsp;spend more time being creative.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>USE YOUR CALENDAR (AND SYNC IT TO YOUR PHONE)</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
For me, calendars are a must when it comes to scheduling meetings and looking at timelines. Whenever you start a new project, mark it on your calendar that way you can see how long it actually took when it&rsquo;s completed. I have a calendar for work and for my personal&nbsp;life. If you prefer a planner, that's great too. Writing and crossing off items are my guilty pleasure.</p>
<p><em>(Sidenote: We&rsquo;re adults now, and in this busy world of work, we need to schedule time for play.)</em></p>
<p>The beauty of synching a Google Calendar to your iCal&nbsp;is that it can&nbsp;automatically add important dates that are in&nbsp;your inbox to your calendar.&nbsp;Ta-da!</p>
<p>I know&nbsp;most of us know this and say, &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah I have all this set up, duh." But actually using that calendars it is a different story. Make sure your notifications are turned on, on both your desktop and phone, that way you&rsquo;re reminded of what you need to accomplish that day.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> USE&nbsp;APPS&nbsp;AND MAKE TO-DO LISTS</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
<a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202335" target="_blank">Reminders</a> have saved my life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re one of those people who are always thinking of things they need to do but never write it down, this is where to&nbsp;begin.</p>
<p>First things first, sync&nbsp;<strong>e v e r y t h i n&nbsp;g</strong>&nbsp;through iCloud. This way it&rsquo;s all cohesive and if you miss/forget about the reminder on your phone - your desktop will remind you as well.</p>
<p>The Reminders App is a quick, easy to use to-do list&nbsp;that let&rsquo;s you have different task lists&nbsp;and to-do&rsquo;s under each one. Of course there are other apps that might have a different/more fun interface but at the end of the day, I always came back to reminders so I didn&rsquo;t have to worry about external apps that I needed to download on my computer as well.</p>
<p>You can also schedule a time in each task by&nbsp;clicking the (i) button on the right side of each item. You can even have it remind you when you get to a location (!!). My go-to is creating reminders while I&rsquo;m&nbsp;driving (through Siri&nbsp;of course because somehow that&rsquo;s when all my ideas come to me) and then having her remind me of them when I pull into my apartment. That girl is a lifesaver sometimes.</p>
<p>Evernote is an amazing app that sync&rsquo;s notes across all your devices. I use different notebooks to jot down ideas when it comes to blogs, client work and internal company work. I also sometimes make to do lists within these notes with their own little checkbox bullet&nbsp;points that make me feel all giddy every time I cross&nbsp;one off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> ORGANIZE YOUR FILES AND DESKTOP</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
A big issue&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve seen is that the Mac drag &amp; drop feature has become a blessing and a curse.&nbsp;Of course the ease of dragging any image you see online to your desktop is SO convenient, but before you know it,&nbsp;your desktop is filled with screenshots galore and no method to your madness.</p>
<p>One morning (a week or month, depending on your habits)&nbsp;before you do anything, don&rsquo;t open anything&nbsp;on your computer and glare at that desktop. It&rsquo;s time&nbsp;to tackle it.&nbsp;Create folder&nbsp;categories that majority of your images/documents fall under and start filing! You&rsquo;ll feel much better when you get a chance to actually see that beautiful wallpaper and know that&nbsp;all your files have a home.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> MAKE TIME FOR YOURSELF</strong></li><br />
</ol><br />
All of this might sound overwhelming and if you made it to this final task,&nbsp;than cheers to you!&nbsp;After all is said and done and to-do lists are tackled, make sure you take downtime for yourself.</p>
<p>Detach from your daily grind and do something that simply makes you happy. De-stressing your mind will often lead to those creative ideas you may be spending hours in your office to come up with.</p>
<p>The first steps to getting organized may not be easy, but once your there and you keep up with it, you&rsquo;ll be surprised how much more efficient you can be!</p>
