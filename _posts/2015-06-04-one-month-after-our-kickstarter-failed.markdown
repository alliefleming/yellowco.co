<p>It's been just over a month since our <a href="http://yellowconference.com/freetofail/" target="_blank">Kickstarter failure</a>, so I thought I would check in with you ladies for a little #realtalk. Thank you for&nbsp;the feedback you had on&nbsp;my <a href="http://yellowconference.com/freetofail/" target="_blank">original post</a>. It warms my heart to know it encouraged so many&nbsp;of you.</p>
<p>To celebrate our failure (we have to celebrate these things!) we had a Fail Party a few weeks ago where we invited you all&nbsp;to come hang out with us, eat cupcakes and have intentional conversations&nbsp;about fear and&nbsp;risk taking. Women openly shared their experiences with failure, as well as their plan to take more risks.</p>
<p>At the party, we filled out <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FAIL_EXERCISE_BLOG.pdf" target="_blank">this worksheet</a> that helped us examine what we have learned from our failures. It also gave&nbsp;us time to think about risks that we wanted to take that month. Feel like you need a bit more risk in your life? Going through your own failure? Feel free to print out <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FAIL_EXERCISE_BLOG.pdf" target="_blank">this worksheet</a> and use it as you choose!</p>
<p>My friend (and member of the&nbsp;#bloomdude crew) <a href="http://timoberg.com/" target="_blank">Tim</a> joined us at the party and made this fun video documenting the night.</p>

<p>This month has been an interesting one. So many people have been asking me how I'm feeling&nbsp;after this whole thing. The truth is, right now I'm doing really well. The first few weeks after this ended I was sad and definitely felt myself going into a dark place at times, but I'm feeling good now. Kickstarter is an&nbsp;emotional and time consuming project. Now that it's over, I feel like I was fired from a job, giving me all this time and clear head space! It's funny how when&nbsp;things don't work out the way we plan, they're&nbsp;often a blessing in disguise.</p>
<p>So now, we are busy working away at making this year's <a href="http://yellowconference.com/" target="_blank">Yellow Conference</a> the best that it can be. We have so many amazing <a href="http://yellowconference.com/#2015-speakers" target="_blank">speakers and workshop leaders</a> this year. I can't wait for you to experience the knowledge, wisdom and stories they have. We've also just added <a href="http://yellowconference.com/mentor-sessions" target="_blank">Mentor Sessions</a> to our ticket line up, which allows you to sit down and talk with our speakers 1-on-1. Pretty stoked to be offering that this year.</p>
<p>If you read my <a href="http://yellowconference.com/freetofail/" target="_blank">post last month</a>, my hope is&nbsp;it has encouraged&nbsp;you to step out and take more risks. Know&nbsp;that failure is always a possibility,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the <em>fear</em> of failure will put a stop to&nbsp;many more of your dreams than <em>actual</em> failure will.</p>
<p>Too often we only hear about the successes. It's important&nbsp;to know that with every success story there are a thousand failure stories as well. So talk about your failures. Not after the fact- that's too easy. I'm saying talk about them&nbsp;<em>when</em> they happen.</p>
<p>Trust me- I know it's embarrassing, it's vulnerable. I can't tell you how many people have sent me articles on failure, tagged me in a failure quote on Instagram, or look at&nbsp;me when failure is mentioned in conversation... Not sure how I feel about becoming known as the "girl who failed" but hey, I'll take it if I know that it inspires people!</p>
<p>Step out. Fail big. Talk about it. Be brave. Be vulnerable. Life is too short not to.</p>

<p>Thanks as always for your love and support,</p>
