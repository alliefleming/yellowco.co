Just wanted to drop by to say a quick THANK YOU to everyone who was involved in the very first Yellow Conference. I (Joanna) had an amazing time, and am still running off the high of inspiration from the conference. So much of what made the event awesome was the amazing attendees whose brave hearts and souls are changing history in our world today. They definitely have made an impact on me personally.

We will be posting a full recap of the event with photos, videos and more next week, but for now I just wanted to drop in and tell you that you are all amazing, and to thank you for making Yellow awesome. We have some really fun things planned for the near future, so sign up for our new monthly newsletter "[Yellow Letters](http://bit.ly/1xz0Ozf)" (first one going out Oct 1st!) hang with us on [Insta](http://instagram.com/yellowconference), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yellowconf) and [FB](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Yellow-Conference/1393841977549340) to stay in the loop!
