<p>If you haven't heard by now, <a href="https://yellowco.myshopify.com/collections/the-yellow-collective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Yellow Collective</a> is o-to-the-pen. Wide open until June 30th. That means this is your chance to join the most <em>incredible</em>&nbsp;group of women I've ever had the chance of getting to know. The Yellow Collective members aren't your average "women in business" kind of gals.</p>
<h3>The women&nbsp;in our community are&nbsp;fiercely passionate, extraordinarily creative, beautifully brave, <em>and</em>&nbsp;they have a deep desire, a hunger even, to serve something bigger than themselves.</h3><br />
To make the world a better place, to spread goodness, and come fully ALIVE. Let me just tell you, when these women come together, it is <em>powerful</em>.&nbsp;BIG things happen. Like, world changing stuff.</p>
<p>Instead of talking your ear off about how amazing&nbsp;our members are, I thought it would be even better for you to hear directly from them about who they are and what their experience in the Collective has been like. Sound good?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shayarees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaya Rees</a>&nbsp;is an administrative assistant at the <a href="http://negu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessie Rees Foundation</a> and one of the most motivated young creatives we&rsquo;ve met. This girl is truly using her gifts to make the world a better place.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-20-at-8.49.25-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8828" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-20-at-8.49.25-AM.png" alt="" width="786" height="780" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://yellowcollective.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Yellow Collective</a> has been the greatest blessing in my life lately,&rdquo; she said.</strong></h3><br />
&ldquo;<strong><em>I have an incredible group of women who encourage me, push me, teach me, and share their wisdom. It&rsquo;s a place where I feel safe and know that I can be vulnerable&hellip; They teach me to be myself, trust the path that I am on, and never stop pursing [my] dreams!"</em></strong></p>
<p>Another one of our members, Cassidy Perry, is a social media coach and web manager. She shared with&nbsp;us that the Collective has been a <em>&ldquo;wonderful and delightful surprise&rdquo;</em> that didn&rsquo;t fit the traditional networking model.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;<em>What I found was genuinely caring young women who care about helping each other grow in all areas of life and business,</em>&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;This is truly a unique group of women who don&rsquo;t just talk about supporting each other but truly show up and are there for each other&hellip; I&rsquo;ve gained confidence that business can be done with vulnerability and kindness. You don&rsquo;t have to be cutthroat to succeed."</em></strong></p>
<p>The Collective is definitely the type of membership where you get out of it what you put in. Even though it can be scary to share who you are and put yourself out there, Collective member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/flyingfreediaries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zantika Ellis</a> reminded us that it&rsquo;s <em>so</em>&nbsp;worth it.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<strong>I&rsquo;ve learned to step out of my comfort zone and to be okay with the anxiety that comes with doing so,</strong>&rdquo; she said.</h3><br />
<a href="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-20-at-8.59.30-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8830" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-06-20-at-8.59.30-AM.png" alt="" width="953" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>Stepping out and <em>moving</em>&nbsp;despite fear and anxiety? Zantika is the definition of a girlboss.&nbsp;Each quarter, we send out&nbsp;Empowerment Boxes as part of our membership. It's so much fun to see our members <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yellowcollective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post about them on&nbsp;Instagram</a>&nbsp;and see how much joy they bring - not to mention all the goodness inside.</p>
<p>Sara Fitzgerald, one of our members, said, <em><strong>&ldquo;That box was like a ray of sunshine sitting on my porch, full of things to inspire, resources, and wisdom!&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>Every Wednesday evening, we host a Slack Chat on a different topic. We&rsquo;ve discussed creativity, vulnerability, boundaries &mdash; you name it! No matter where our members are, the chats offer a place to connect on a regular basis.</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gained a strong sense of community from our weekly Slack Chats as we shower each other with encouragement, wisdom, and tools to utilize in our everyday lives,&rdquo;</strong> </em>shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britneylclark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Clark</a>, a speaker and financial professional.</p>
<h3><strong>"I&rsquo;ve learned we&rsquo;re all connected in some way."</strong></h3><br />
I do this because I believe that&nbsp;there's <em>so</em>&nbsp;much to be learned, gained, and experienced by purposeful&nbsp;women coming together. We not only can grow in our character and in our creative endeavors, but we can truly impact the world for the better. What an honor to be apart of something like this.</p>
<p>We would love to have you join us as a Collective member this quarter. If you have any questions, shoot an email over to rachel@yellowco.co.</p>
