<h3><em>Hey ladies,</em></h3></p>
<h3><em>Are you ready for <a href="http://yellowco.co/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yellow Conference 2017</a>?</em></h3><br />
We are busy getting ready over here but are SO excited to gather together with and meet you all in just THREE days! We'll be spending two full&nbsp;days at 440 Seaton in the Arts District of DTLA &nbsp;hanging out with like-minded women, and hearing from incredible <a href="http://yellowco.co/yellow-conference-2017-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speakers like Lisa Gungor, Moorea Seal, and Kohl Crecelius</a>! The inspiration will be overflowing. If you haven't grabbed a ticket already, it's not too late!</p>
