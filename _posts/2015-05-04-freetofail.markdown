  content: Love this!  My brother once told me upon an epic failure of mine ... "Penn,
    we all pay for our education; some in a classroom, some by our failures ... consider
    yourself fortunate" ... I live by that now, especially when I fail ... I chalk
    it up to education and count myself fortunate.  :-)

  content: Thank you for your transparency and for not running away from your situation.
    This is so relevant to my current experience and speaks to me deeply. it's such
    a relief to see someone who is unafraid to talk about failure and even celebrate
    it. Wish with all my heart I could join your talk in LA, but I'm on the east coast.
    Blessings on your efforts. I look forward to hearing how the next days and months
    unfold for you.

    This is the first post I've read from yellowconference.com and you've got yourself a new reader. Thank you so much for being so transparent - it's really admirable. The fact that you put so much hard work and effort in shows just how much you want it &amp; you won't give up. I think that's one of the most important characteristics a person can have.

  content: Totally echoing the sentiments below - I'm new here, I'm impressed, and
    I'm hooked. This internet is overflowing with inspirational quotes in pretty letters
    about 'failure' and 'vulnerability', but instances like this that show real transparency
    and courage are rare. I really love what Yellow Conference is all about, and as
    much as this makes me wish I was still in LA, I'm looking forward to following
    along from afar (waving from the east coast!) and seeing what you all tackle next!

    applause - as you said, these types of stories, about the failures, or the not-quite's,
    are rarely heard, so it's refreshing to read this here. Much love and luck to
    you for your next step - it seems as though you have 3 new cheerleaders, myself
    included, here to support and cheer you on!

    yup... we need to fail in order to grow. great post!

    kickstarter's all or nothing concept is tough. maybe indiegogo or something might work out better, because you get to keep whatever you've raised (minus their fee).

<p>Well ladies, we worked our booties off. We cried, we shouted, we laughed, we smiled, we got angry and we got happy. All of these things happened throughout this past month of our Kickstarter. And you know what? It failed.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6LvcybSAwNUpdOVIJEDkfnZiEnMvxDTSEWpj5uMcUpokVdshMNHROIz3wkt04G1FxH2y5tKh1VR6Tk5wZ_FMGI.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2730" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/6LvcybSAwNUpdOVIJEDkfnZiEnMvxDTSEWpj5uMcUpokVdshMNHROIz3wkt04G1FxH2y5tKh1VR6Tk5wZ_FMGI-682x1024.jpg" alt="6LvcybSAwNUpdOVIJEDkfnZiEnMvxDTSEWpj5uMcUpo,kVdshMNHROIz3wkt04G1FxH2y5tKh1VR6Tk5wZ_FMGI" width="682" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>I (Joanna) really believed we could make this happen. I know we were trying to raise a lot of money, but I really believed deep down that we had the power to do this, if only we worked hard enough. When I first realized this maybe wasn't going to happen, it was really hard. I had migraines, got sick, cried a lot and felt&nbsp;extremely embarrassed and vulnerable. I just couldn't take the thought that this thing I had poured so much of myself into, this thing that I believed in so strongly could fail.</p>
<p>If you and I were sitting and chatting over a cup of coffee, I would look you in the eyes and tell you at this moment, today, I'm ok, and that would be an honest answer. I'm actually more than ok. I feel really good right now. Ready to regroup and excited to celebrate this failure.</p>
<p>I had a mentor of mine sit down with me the other day, and after I told her that I was feeling&nbsp;really embarrassed for everyone to see this thing fail, she said to me, "Oh honey. You <em>can not</em> waste your energy on that. This will&nbsp;one of <em>many</em> failures that will happen in your life. It's all apart of being an entrepreneur." BAM.</p>
<p>Failures do not define us. These things that don't succeed do not create our identity. We are more than what we do, and we can move on from failures and learn! One of my favorite scenes from one of my favorite movies, Elizabethtown comes to mind when I write this.</p>
<p>In the scene below, the main character has just been fired from his job because he invented a shoe design that lost the company over a BILLION dollars. See below:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jrf263yJwic" width="700" height="415" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>My favorite quote from this scene: "You want to be really great? Then have the courage to FAIL BIG&nbsp;and stick around. Make them wonder why you're still smiling. That's true greatness to me." What a great reminder, and a great encouragement to us all!</p>
<p>The reason I want to talk about our Kickstarter failing is because I want YOU to see that yes, this failed, and look, it's ok! You can fail to! Let's talk about our failures and learn from them. Let's be open about the fact that this stuff we are trying to do is not easy. And let's encourage each other to continue to take risks, be brave and know that even if you do fail- things are going to be ok. It's what you learn along the way that will really make you great.</p>
<p>How often do you see inspirational quotes on Pinterest talking about failure? I see them all the time. But how often do you see people actually talking about their personal or business failures? Those you rarely see. So I want to talk about this and&nbsp;be completely open about the things learned along the way.</p>
<p>This Kickstarter may have failed, but this project is not a failure. We have learned A TON and we are not done here. We are regrouping, re-strategizing, and figuring out what's next. The Yellow Room&nbsp;is still happening, it's just a matter of when, where and how. Stay tuned. We're not finished yet.</p>
<p>We had brunch as a Yellow team last weekend and decided that we needed to celebrate this failure. So because of that we are going to have a #freetofail party this Friday night- and you're invited! Nothing fancy, just a hangout, closure and celebration of the end of our Kickstarter campaign. We would love to have you <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/free-to-fail-party" target="_blank">join us</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FreetoFail_Party.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2880" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FreetoFail_Party-1024x666.jpg" alt="FreetoFail_Party" width="700" height="455" /></a>Space is limited, so if you'd like to come, <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/free-to-fail-party" target="_blank">RSVP here</a> and let us know you're coming.</p>
<p>Thank you to every single person who backed our Kickstarter. And thank you to everyone who posted about it on social media, talked to friends or sent an encouraging email or text. Every single one of you is apart of what we're doing.</p>
<p>We're not done ladies. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
