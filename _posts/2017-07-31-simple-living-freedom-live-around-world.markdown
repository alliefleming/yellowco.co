<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to think that having less would constrain me and limit my freedom, but not until I embraced minimalism did I realize just how freeing this a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simpler</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> life is. Minimizing within my life has created a side effect that has changed everything: the freedom to become location independent. Now, I get to travel for most of the year and spend the rest of the time at my home base in the San Francisco Bay Area!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of life allows me to pick up and go whenever I choose, because I don&rsquo;t have anything holding me down. It is a result of freeing up space in my life for the things that I really love, and letting go of the rest. When we learn to simplify and get rid of all the excess that we don&rsquo;t need, we are left with our true desires and can focus on cherishing those items, people, and experiences!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you're hoping to be able to work remotely around the world, or simply un-complicate your life a bit, try these tips&nbsp;to create a freedom-based lifestyle:</span></p>
<h3><b>Only surround yourselves with what &ldquo;sparks joy&rdquo;.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven&rsquo;t read </span><a href="http://tidyingup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up&rdquo; by Marie Kondo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I definitely recommend it! It really did change my life. After reading it, I started looking at physical things in a different way. Material items&nbsp;are here for us to use and enjoy. So, if I own something that makes me feel happy, peaceful, or beautiful, then I&rsquo;ll keep it. If not, out it goes!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new outlook helped me create a capsule wardrobe of all my favorite clothes, and it finally allowed me to get rid of clothing that I was holding onto. Now I have a smaller wardrobe of pieces that I love, look good in, and that can be mixed and matched to create endless combinations. This is the beauty of simplifying - even just within your closet! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting rid of anything and everything that didn&rsquo;t spark joy catapulted me on my journey to a freedom-based lifestyle. After bags and bags of clothing and objects were donated, I noticed that I had downsized over 50% of everything I owned. Being able to let go of and not depend on material things has given me so much freedom to enjoy other parts of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along the same lines of carefully choosing the possessions I have in my life, I also started to be more selective with the people I spent time with and the activities I chose to do. I decided to focus my time on&nbsp;people that bring me joy and doing activities I love doing. Our time is precious, so let's spend it where it matters most to us!</span></p>

<h3><b>Don&rsquo;t tie yourself down.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you&rsquo;re at your home base, think about renting month-to-month in a furnished place. This way, you don&rsquo;t need to buy any furniture or store it when you move out. Plus, you have the freedom to move whenever you want without needing to find a sub-letter, worry about the landlord or maintenance, or pay rent while traveling. You can also rent the coolest places on </span><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AirBnB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;for shorter stints, usually meeting interesting people along the way!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While traveling, put what you can on hold. Suspend your phone plan. Ask for a deferment on your student loans. Unsubscribe from your yoga membership or&nbsp;meal subscription boxes. Pay off your bills, or put everything on auto-payment so you don&rsquo;t have to constantly check your accounts while abroad. Doing these can not only free you up financially, but keep you from being distracted from the&nbsp;present.</span></p>
<h3><b>Take everything online.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My switch to a location-independent lifestyle involved shifting business models to&nbsp;take everything online. At the time, my social enterprise non-profit was heavily focused on revenue from handcrafted products to fund our social programs in Africa. If you have a product-based business, you know how it is: hours of marketing, photography, quality control, packaging, and order fulfillment. A model&nbsp;that is nearly impossible to do&nbsp;without having physical inventory to work with. Instead, my organization shifted its business model to focus on a monthly giving program and online donations. This way, I was able to work online from anywhere in the world. So far this year I&rsquo;ve been able to run my non-profit from San Francisco, Brazil, South Africa, NYC, Peru, and Mozambique!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also took inventory of all my skills and interests to see what other types of online work I could do. This inspired me to start a conscious travel and social impact blog, as well as&nbsp;launch a consulting company for world changers and impact makers! By looking deeper into what I already have, I've been able to make a living while both traveling and doing what I love.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I learned to say "yes" to the things, people, and experiences that light me up, and&nbsp;say "no" to all the others, I saw life become an incredible journey. One that didn't involve feelings of obligation, guilt, or resentment. I was able to make space for what I truly cherished, and let go of the rest.&nbsp;To create not just a location independent lifestyle, but one filled with freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>
