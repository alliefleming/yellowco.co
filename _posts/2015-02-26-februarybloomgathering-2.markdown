What a night! Last Friday, we gathered with some incredible women (dreamers, achievers, and leaders of all sorts) to talk over the foundation and mission of Yellow, along with future plans. We not only shared with you our excitement over the future of Yellow, but also gave the Bloom Gathering attendees time to participate in an exercise called "Your Crazy Awesome Thing," where we explored what we'd like to accomplish (no dream too big or to small!) and what we felt were the barriers of these things...then we shared in groups and spent the rest of the evening mingling on the beautiful rooftop, with the most outrageous (in the very best way) view...

All the while being filmed by our new friends from [Harbr.co](http://harbr.co/) for our upcoming Kickstarter!!

If you missed our last Bloom Gathering, or haven't seen our recent announcements, the Yellow Team is beyond excited to announce our biggest endeavor yet: we will be launching a Kickstarter sometime this Spring in hopes to raise funds for **The Yellow Room. **

**The Yellow Room **is a new and exciting dream we have for an online forum to globally connect like minded women, giving them the tools, accountability, and community they need to make a positive impact on their community, and the world, and to live a life filled with passion.
