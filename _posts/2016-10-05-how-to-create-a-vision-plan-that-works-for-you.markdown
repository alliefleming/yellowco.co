<h2><em><strong>"Creating is not magic, but work" &mdash; Kevin Ashton</strong></em></h2><br />
 When I was approached to share my thoughts on the subject <a href="http://yellowconference.com/2016/10/03/our-next-series-heart/" target="_blank">Heart</a>, I immediately thought about what gets in my way when trying to fulfill my heart's desire. I often have a clear vision-I know what I want and how I want it to look; but the clarity breaks down as I move back from my desired vision to the present reality. Goals which were once motivating start to feel too far away, too hard, or worse-lost in a sea of jumbled thoughts and ambitions.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>You know the feeling: you don&rsquo;t even know if you&rsquo;ve reached your goal <em>because you don&rsquo;t really know what your goal is. </em></strong></p>
<h2><strong>This is an action based article to help you connect your goals to achievable tasks, ask the right questions, reflect, then plan. </strong></h2><br />
<strong><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7044" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-82.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-82" width="700" height="467" />Let&rsquo;s talk about the logistics of creating the path:</strong> I&rsquo;ve included a handful of questions and examples which I often use to prompt myself to build and stay committed to better planning models.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Vision&rdquo; &nbsp;</em>is a broad term with billions of resources about how you can create a vision plan for yourself. This isn&rsquo;t a new concept, but I hope the way I talk, examples I give, and outline will spark inspiration to get in touch with what you want.</p>
<p> <strong>Every day, I work with clients who let me hold them accountable to their vision</strong>. For every decision these entrepreneurs make, in careers, relationships, and health, I encourage them to ask this question of themselves: <em>&ldquo;Will this push to me reach my goal?&rdquo; </em> </p>
<p> <strong>Let&rsquo;s think of your career goals as a vacation (ha!).</strong> &nbsp;When you have a limited amount of time and money, you want to know where you&rsquo;re going and what you&rsquo;re doing to plan the exact adventure you want. Let&rsquo;s say a modest budget, staying off the usual tourist path &amp; eating amazing food were your three big goals.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-81.jpg"><br />
</a>  </p>
<p><b>No plan or adventure is without its pivots.</b>  Sleeping accommodations throw in an extra fee, or you have a fancy meal that wasn&rsquo;t on the original itinerary. These &ldquo;setbacks&rdquo; adjust the budget (you stayed in a beautiful town you didn&rsquo;t know existed!) and if each decision is made with the end goal in mind (the food was recommended by every local!) &mdash; you&rsquo;re on the right path. </p>
<p> <strong>Walking away from an adventure with a sense of accomplishment, knowing you&rsquo;ve made decisions with your best self in mind, is priceless.</strong> From the outside it may look like a typical vacation, but you know that everything you did fit within your mission. </p>
<blockquote><p><em>...If each decision is made with the end goal in mind...&mdash; you&rsquo;re on the right path. Walking away from an adventure with a sense of accomplishment, knowing you've made decisions with your best self in mind, is priceless.</em></blockquote></p>
<h2><em><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-81.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7043" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-81.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-81" width="700" height="467" /></a></em><em>Finding your purpose (and capturing it in a mission statement):</em></h2><br />
 You are used to taking action. You&rsquo;re a high-achiever with goals in mind. <em>But you want more.</em> Bigger! Broader!  But stop and ask yourself this: <em><strong>what is your purpose?</strong></em>  To be the best copywriter anyone has ever worked with? To project manage your clients like a rock star? To take the best pet portraits the world has ever seen?  </p>
<p>First, ask yourself <em>what</em> you do for others, <em>why</em> you do it, and <em>refine</em> it into a mission statement.  A mission statement may sound like a big, scary, or pointless exercise. <strong>It's not.</strong>&nbsp;Writing out&nbsp;who you are now and where you&rsquo;d like to go and what you want is not pointless.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-80.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7042" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-80.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-80" width="700" height="467" /></a> <strong>Assignment One (of three): The questions below are simple. Take 10-30 minutes on each without censoring or editing:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> What do you do?  </em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> What happened to get you where you are now? </em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> What do you like about what you do? </em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> Why do you do it?  </em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> Who do you do it for? </em></li><br />
</ul><br />
 <strong>Like you, your mission statement grows and evolves...</strong>The specifics shift and change as life and your business grow. Regardless of its changing nature, it will be your guide.  </p>
<h2><em>Navigating Your Goals: past, present, future</em></h2><br />
 <strong>To navigate to your future goals it is deeply&nbsp;important to understand what you wanted in the past, how you attempted to get what you wanted, and whether or not you got what you wanted.</strong> Knowing what worked and what didn&rsquo;t, and understanding&nbsp;why, is the key to better planning and outcomes. </p>
<p>Remember: this is about <i>all</i>  of your goals, both business and personal. Your business is connected to your life (and at times it might  <i> be </i>  your life) so don&rsquo;t throw out a goal because you don&rsquo;t see the direct connection to your career yet. </p>
<h4><strong>Assignment Two:</strong> <b>Understand all facets of your life and career and be OK with doing what it takes to get the results you want.&nbsp;</b></h4><br />
Knowing where you&rsquo;ve been is the start to understanding what&rsquo;s actually possible <em>(don&rsquo;t skip this exercise).</em>&nbsp;Answer the following (again, unfiltered):</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> What were your financial goals last year?  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> What was your financial outcome last year?  
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> What happened?  </em></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em> Why?  </em></li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li> What do you want to be different this time around?<br />
 </li></p>
<li> What were your creative goals last year?<br />
 </li></p>
<li> What were your creative outcomes last year?&nbsp; 
<ul>
<li><em>What happened?&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Why?&nbsp;</em></li><br />
</ul><br />
</li></p>
<li>&nbsp;What do you want to be different this upcoming year?</li>
<li>If you could do ANYTHING, what would it be?</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-51.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7045" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/ValerieDenisePhotos-51.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-51" width="700" height="467" /></a>Now, create a pathway:</strong></h2><br />
 You have uncovered who you are, who you want to be, and the goals associated with all of it. Now let&rsquo;s make a path toward achieving your goals. Goals can be daunting and like most things in life, small, actionable sub-task will be the way to success. I lean heavily on questions (on top of questions) to inspire strategy and creativity.  </p>
<h4><strong>Assignment Three (of three!): Follow this outline for each &ldquo;goal.&rdquo; The&nbsp;examples below are from my 2016/17 path: &nbsp;</strong></h4></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Reformat the goal in the structure of a question.  <i><i> Ex: How can I increase one-on-one clients from 5 per quarter to 10? </i></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Create sub-questions to help pull out the specific tasks involved. &nbsp; <i><i> ex: How will I fit each new client into my schedule? How will they hear about me? Some answers: Content, press, clear outline of values, on-boarding systems. </i></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">From your answers you will start to uncover the tasks, creating smaller goals so you can chip away at the big <i><i> ex: Research client systems that will help onboard 10 new clients a quarter. Ex: Plan website updates. </i></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Where do these tasks fit into your life? <i> ex: to reach new clients, I need to create content for distribution. I have a goal of two articles per quarter for partners and 2 blog posts per month. I input the writing, research, and editing time into my project management system (google calendar). </i></li><br />
</ol></p>
<h2><strong>Remember: <em>Heart work is hard.</em></strong></h2><br />
 These assignments are time consuming and difficult. They take time away from the work that gives you instant gratification (money), but I know from experience that by making a plan and setting goals, and breaking them down into achievable action items, will give you the confidence and the structure to make headway in your life and career.  </p>
<p><em> I&rsquo;d love to hear about your goals. We will talk about your pathways to goals, how the goals relate to your success, or aspects of these assignments that have you a little bit stuck. &nbsp; <b>I am giving discounted consulting sessions through December 15th, 2016 to Yellow Co.
