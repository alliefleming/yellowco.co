<p>We are excited to announce a new breed of Bloom Gatherings that we will be hosting from time to time as specific causes call our hearts to action. We are starting with this Month's collaboration with <a href="http://www.coasttocoastcentral.com/" target="_blank">Coast to Coast Central</a> to host a <a href="http://www.coasttocoastcentral.com/thedarlingparty/" target="_blank">Darling Party</a>.</p>
<p>Here at Yellow we are all about empowering creative women to using their gifts for good, to dream big, to change the world. At this month's Bloom Gathering we are going to be working together help fulfill the dreams of sex trafficking survivors.&nbsp;The purpose of this event is to unite us together to fight for a beautiful and worthy cause, the plight against sex trafficking. This is a reminder that we have been given the ability + freedom to not only dream, but to <em>pursue</em> the dreams brewing in our hearts. This event will not only inspire us to live out lives of passion, but help the women who have been victims of human trafficking to pursue their dreams as well.</p>
<p><strong>100%</strong> of the profits go towards creating sustainable change for survivors of sex trafficking in Ecuador. The Darling funds will provide a safe home for survivors as they rehabilitate. Each survivor will not only be given a home, but counseling sessions to help with inner healing, educational classes, business classes, and skills training. Their rehabilitation will equip them to enter back into society as strong women who are dreamers and leaders. How amazing is that??</p>
