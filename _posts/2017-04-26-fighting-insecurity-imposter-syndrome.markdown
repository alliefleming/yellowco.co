  content: The last point you made about being the paintbrush, not the artist is SOLID
    GOLD! I couldn't agree more. This is something that I always struggle with, trying
    to "convince" clients to work with me, I feel like I need to say why I am the
    best person for this job, etc. But, all I really want to do is use my knowledge
    to help them succeed! I'm brainstorming ways to better get that message across.

  content: Hey, Cassandra! I just now saw this, and I wanted to validate how incredibly
    frustrating it can be to feel like you have to "convince" clients of your worth!
    I don't know a single entrepreneur who doesn't struggle with this. I personally
    try to present my offers as an opportunity for my clients to say yes to themselves,
    with me simply there as the guide. I'm curious to hear how your brainstorming
    went and if things feel better to you.

    Amy,

    The brainstorming took a lot from me, especially because I realized that one thing I should have done in the beginning is niche down even more who my target audience is. Besides trying to be a "wide painbrush" that covered everything in one stroke, i'm more of a "detail paint brush" or at least one of the medium sized ones that can be used by specific and certain people to improve their message and reach the right audience. I think I'm making a lot of progress and feel like I'm less of an imposter! (:

  content: Cassandra, this is so amazing! I love, love, love your realization that
    you needed to niche down more. I think that as purpose-based entrepreneurs, we
    really care about what we do, so we beat ourselves up for "not being good enough"
    sometimes when really it's just a simple strategy fix like that. I'm so glad you
    are feeling like less of an imposter and embracing your "detail brush" side! Cheers
    to owning it!

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I first moved to Los Angeles, I was keen on two things: finding my creative purpose and meeting as many people as possible. When I inevitably found myself at dinner parties with new friends, there was a familiar beat in the conversations when someone would ask some version of, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;So, what&rsquo;s your deal? What do you do for a living?&rdquo;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I routinely answered in the most convoluted way possible. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m currently working in project management, but my passion is women&rsquo;s empowerment - and I&rsquo;m thinking about studying graphic design or starting a blog, but bills, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a lot of awkward smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a pretty confusing time trying to define my direction and identity. Looking&nbsp;back, I now realize that it would have been much, much simpler&nbsp;if I had allowed myself to respond with the truth: </span><strong><i>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a creative.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i></strong>Sure, I was a directionless, closeted one&nbsp;at the moment, but a creative nonetheless.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that not being brave enough to take&nbsp;my identity as a creative seriously meant&nbsp;that no one else would either. It was time for me to own it, and stop letting imposter syndrome take the wheel. N<span style="font-weight: 400;">ow, I have a pretty solid understanding of who I am, what I do, and even how to be successful at it - but there are still times when I meet new people and dread talking about my work. I feel this insecurity&nbsp;bubbling up in my stomach and wonder, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Are they going to get it? And even if they do, are they going to value it, or tell me to get a real job?&rdquo;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Doing this dance with fear is complex, but in time what I've learned from it is simple:</span></p>
<h3><b>As long as you feel insecure about your right to call yourself a creative, you will never be reaching your creative potential.&nbsp;</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, what will it take? What needs to happen for you truly own your creative side? To feel confident declaring what you&rsquo;re about, and not want to hide when someone asks?</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8432 size-full" title="FIGHTING THE INSECURITIES OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME - THE YELLOW ROOM" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/DSC0516.jpg" alt="FIGHTING THE INSECURITIES OF IMPOSTER SYNDROME - THE YELLOW ROOM" width="2048" height="1356" /><b></b></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>1. Update your beliefs.</b></h3></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like you wouldn&rsquo;t run ancient software on your new Mac and expect it to work well, don&rsquo;t expect your soul to run on outdated beliefs. What do you believe about creatives? How about your creative abilities? Which perceptions&nbsp;need a bit of an update? In my case, I needed to take a good look at my belief that all creatives end up as starving artists. I made it my mission to look for creatives that were&nbsp;successful and still had a healthy&nbsp;relationship with money - and I found them. The thing about outdated beliefs like this is that they easily collapse with evidence, so go out and find it.</span></p></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>2. Out yourself in small ways.</b></h3></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We are conditioned to get identity approval everywhere but within, so it makes perfect sense that we shut down when someone judges our creative side. When&nbsp;your identity is even a little fragile, it&rsquo;s tempting to keep it safe and hidden, but doing so won't&nbsp;get you anywhere. Try 'outing yourself' in low-stakes situations first. If your secret passion is writing, tell a complete stranger that you&rsquo;re a writer. If you want to sell sustainable jewelry on Etsy, introduce yourself&nbsp;as such to someone new.&nbsp;Even if you feel foolish at first, start sharing your creativity in small ways and see if confidence follows.</p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of my favorite quotes from Amanda Palmer&rsquo;s book on art and vulnerability, <em>The Art of Asking</em>, addresses how tough it is to put yourself out there as a creative. She says, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re an artist, nobody ever tells you or hits you with the magic wand of legitimacy. You have to hit your own head with your own handmade wand. And you feel stupid doing it.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></i></p></p>
<h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><b>3. Be the paintbrush, not the artist.</b></h3></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop making it about you. Seriously. That business you want to launch? It&rsquo;s not about you. That art you want to make? Nope, not actually about you. My ego wants to make my coaching and writing all about how brilliant I am, so I therefore tend to get attached the outcome. But when I&rsquo;m honest with myself, the truth is that I am simply a vessel for the messages that need be heard by&nbsp;my clients. My job is to create&nbsp;space for clients to have their own breakthroughs. Embracing this role releases so much worry or fear of failure. It gives me the freedom and right to practice my art because I&rsquo;m not the artist -simply the tool.</span></p><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, consider what needs to shift for you to let go of the fear of looking like a fraud. Allow yourself to proudly own your creativity, because until you do, you are limiting your capacity to make the impact you were born to. </span></p>
