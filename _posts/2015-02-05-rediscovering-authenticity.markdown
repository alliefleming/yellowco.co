For so long we have been told that these bodies  
Are stumbling blocks for mans’ morality

We have been told to pick and pull at these bodies  
like moldable clay pieces at the hands of someone who was never our maker

We are told to be counterfeit realities of a entertained fascination  
Orchestrated by Photoshop  
But they neglect, the fact that we are human beings  
Breathing and living and crying and wondering  
Was I made all wrong?

_Is there too much curve in this shape?  
**Too much flat in her chest,  
**Too little grace in her bones?_

I have tried to live on a thin line of embracing these love handles  
And being too much to handle in order to love

Living life as an attempt to be seen beautiful in everyone else’s eyes but my own  
So afraid that if no would dare get close enough to hold me,  
sit me down tell me _girl, you were created for beautiful things _

Slowly, we are becoming more built on the lies being force fed into these bodies

That we've forgotten what truth tastes like  
I want to know that I don’t have to be a size anything  
in order to be told that I am _worthy, enough, worth it_

I want to end this fragmented idea that we are only puzzle pieces until someone else comes along and sows value back into these frames  
-- **we are already whole**

I don’t want to give life to anymore seeds planted in this gut  
that needed to be uprooted a long time ago

I want my daughter to know, that she is nothing porcelain  
She is not someone else's masterpiece  
She is more brick house  
Than temporary home

She is a lighthouse, always guiding, always leading  
And no one has to tell her when to stop shining, because it’s already her job

That she is more temple than ally way  
She is no ones passing through

Tell her that, _Darling, don’t let anyone trace out the atlas of your own maps_  
Do not let them re-write your namesake

Tell her, that her creator already said \_it was good  
\_very good  
when he took his first glance at you

_Don’t let anyone take that away from you_

For so long we’ve been told that these bodies are not ours,  
It’s time we told them differently.
