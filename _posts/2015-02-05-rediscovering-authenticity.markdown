<p style="text-align: justify;">For so long we have been told that these bodies<br />
Are stumbling blocks for mans&rsquo; morality</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have been told to pick and pull at these bodies<br />
like moldable clay pieces at the hands of someone who was never our maker</p><br />
We are told to be counterfeit realities of a entertained fascination<br />
Orchestrated by Photoshop<br />
But they neglect, the fact that we are human beings<br />
Breathing and living and crying and wondering<br />
Was I made all wrong?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Is there too much curve in this shape?<br />
</em><em>Too much flat in her chest,<br />
</em><em>Too little grace in her bones?</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have tried to live on a thin line of embracing these love handles<br />
 And being too much to handle in order to love </p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Living life as an attempt to be seen beautiful in everyone else&rsquo;s eyes but my own<br />
So afraid that if no would dare get close enough to hold me,<br />
sit me down tell me <em>girl, you were created for beautiful things&nbsp;</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Slowly, we are becoming more built on the lies being force fed into these bodies</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That we've forgotten what truth tastes like<br />
I want to know that I don&rsquo;t have to be a size anything<br />
in order to be told that I am <em>worthy, enough, worth it</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to end this fragmented idea that we are only puzzle pieces until someone else comes along and sows value back into these frames<br />
-- <strong>we are already whole</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t want to give life to anymore seeds planted in this gut<br />
that needed to be uprooted a long time ago</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want my daughter to know, that she is nothing porcelain<br />
She is not someone else's masterpiece<br />
She is more brick house<br />
Than temporary home</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She is a lighthouse, always guiding, always leading<br />
And no one has to tell her when to stop shining, because it&rsquo;s already her job</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That she is more temple than ally way<br />
 She is no ones passing through </p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tell her that, <em>Darling, don&rsquo;t let anyone trace out the atlas of your own maps</em><br />
Do not let them re-write your namesake</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tell her, that her creator already said <em>it was good<br />
</em>very good<br />
 when he took his first glance at you </p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Don&rsquo;t let anyone take that away from you</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For so long we&rsquo;ve been told that these bodies are not ours,<br />
It&rsquo;s time we told them differently.</p></p>
