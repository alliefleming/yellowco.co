_“You’ve got this Allie. You can take on LA tonight...”_

### Amongst the social and logistical anxiety, I had been giving myself a pep talk all week.

The Membership Launch Party was the first Yellow event I got to attend as a [Yellow Collective member](http://yellowco.co/membership/). I didn’t know what to expect, but I was excited and nervous all at the same time.

I hopped in my coworker’s car and spot a grey wool hat – she says it’s her go-getter hat. I put it on and channel my inner go-getter, _“Carpool lane, make way, because go-getter Allie is on her way up the 405.”_

We arrived in this trendy little area of Echo Park where juice shops, boutiques, and [The Good Trade](http://www.thegoodtrade.com/) share graffiti-tagged sidewalks. Hanna greeted us at the front door with a fish bowl of icebreakers to ask a stranger. (Go-getter Allie is here though, she doesn’t need any help talking.) Walking into the room, I was immediately entranced by [Joy Oladokun](https://www.instagram.com/joyoladokun/)'s voice and she sang and played her acoustic in the background.

The Good Trade space, where the event was hosted, is so chic and intentionally designed – as expected. With Yellow’s new membership mission, “for the benefit of humankind”, it seemed fitting for these two brands to come together for a night of social good and celebration.

“The Good Trade” neon sign lit up the entire space as the [Yellow Collective](http://yellowco.co/membership/) promo video played alongside. Across the room, drinks by [Austin Cocktails](http://www.austincocktails.com/) and snacks were served. My local BevMo is definitely going to see me soon as I’m now obsessed with their refreshing, all-natural Cucumber Vodka Mojito. Drink in hand, go-getter Allie was ready to mingle.

One corner of the room hosted a membership signup station along with a sneak-peak at the periodical that will be sent out next month. I can’t wait to cozy up with some tea and a blanket to read all of the stories and challenge myself with the workbook questions at the end! Midway through the night, Joanna came on mic to share her vision for the new membership. Additionally, she announced that next year Yellow is planning to do a tour of pop-up conferences across different cities! Pack me in your suitcase, please!

With a fully packed space, the energy of these women was tangible. I instantly connected with two other women in their 20s, and it felt like we’d already been friends forever. I was even introduced to a woman who loves technology, podcasts, and is also from Chicago! Do I have a twin I never knew about?! _"Why am I so comfortable at this party?"_ I wondered. _"Does this hat have magical super powers?"_

### One woman asked me, _“Is this normal… for people to be so helpful, supportive, and friendly?”_

I was just as surprised! By the end of the night, I couldn’t even remember what I was so nervous about. I didn’t need the go-getter hat at all. This launch party for the Yellow membership really brought together truly authentic women (and men) that want to connect with other like-minded people. It was so comforting, and altogether inspiring.

I’m so looking forward to connecting with my local Orange County chapter of the [Yellow Collective](http://yellowco.co/membership/), and seeing how these new friendships bloom.
