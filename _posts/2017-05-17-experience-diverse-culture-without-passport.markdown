<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spent the summer after eighth grade in a bright orange vest, parking cars at the fairgrounds. It was August in Michigan and we had the humidity to prove it. At age 13, this was hardly the glamorous image I wanted my peers to witness, but I was determined to raise enough money to take my first mission trip out of the country. I did, I went, and I was never the same. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I've been incredibly blessed to travel since then; exploring the US as I moved across it, working and saving like crazy to study abroad, and finding a career where traveling was part of the gig.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each experience has offered a new and different perspective for which I&rsquo;ll be forever grateful. However, to be honest, it&rsquo;s not the distance that makes the difference.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Simply being curious about people and cultures that are different from my own, even close to home, is ultimately what has changed me as a person.</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Wendell Holmes said, <em>&ldquo;A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.&rdquo; &nbsp;</em></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&rsquo;t agree more, and want to encourage you to expand your experiences beyond your norm. If you're up for it, follow these&nbsp;four tips to stretch your mind by embracing different cultures.</span></p>

<h3><strong>It doesn't have to be far, it just has to be different.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Often we think experiencing a new culture means going to a far away place, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. Make a plan to visit a restaurant, museum, church, or gathering place that is different from your own. Something as simple as a quick search on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meetup.com</a> can net you a vast array of cultural groups that are usually open to the public. If you don&rsquo;t live in a diverse city, plan a day trip or take a weekend to drive to one. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Do your homework.</strong></h3><br />
Before you head out, do a little research about the culture and place you&rsquo;re going. There may be traditions or customs that are different from your own, so knowing these ahead of time will help ensure you&rsquo;re being respectful to the people and places you&rsquo;re visiting. You can even reach out to someone in the community beforehand and express your interest in getting to know more about their culture.</p>
<h3><strong>Be open and willing to learn.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You won&rsquo;t be able to learn everything from research, and experiencing the culture for yourself is the best part anyway - just be sure to take it in with an open mind and heart. Don't only dwell on&nbsp;what you notice you&rsquo;re not used to. Instead, embrace the differences and be curious about what you can learn from them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Get going.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best things we can do to broaden our perspective is to <em>GO</em>. Get out into your community, your state, your country, or your world and get to know people. And don&rsquo;t wait. The best time to get going is <em>now</em>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&rsquo;t have to park cars at the fairground to find&nbsp;a new experience, that&rsquo;s for sure. But if any opportunity should arise for you to go somewhere you&rsquo;ve never been, I say <em>take it</em>. You&rsquo;ll never regret wearing that orange vest. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
