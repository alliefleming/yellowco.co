It’s here! Our February Bloom Gathering will be happening on the 20th at 6:00pm on the [Hudson Loft Rooftop](http://www.hudsonloft.com/). Bloom Gatherings are our monthly hang outs where we do anything and everything from [raising money for a cause](http://yellowconference.com/category/bloom-for-hope/), to hosting a [goal-setting workshop](http://yellowconference.com/january-bloom-gathering-recap/), to simply having an evening [party](http://yellowconference.com/december-bloom-gathering-recap/). They are great ways to get out of the house, get inspired and connect with like-minded women who want to see good spread in the world.

#### **ATTENTION: This is a very special gathering...**

YES! You read right...we are in the midst of creating our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) campaign and want YOU to be a part of that process! At our next Gathering, February 20th, we will be shooting our Kickstarter video, sharing about the heart of Yellow, and what we are hoping to achieve in this next chapter... THIS IS REALLY EXCITING STUFF GUYS!

Tickets are $9 and includes light snacks, drinks, and a network of awesomely creative women who desire to use their gifts for good. We hope you can be a part of this _very_ special evening! If you've never attended a Bloom Gathering before, this is a great time to jump in, as you'll be hearing about Yellow's mission.
