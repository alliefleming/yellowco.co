I was driving up to Santa Barbara with my boyfriend (now husband) for a wedding and it was 3 days before I was going to be with talking to my CEO and giving him the news. I had run through all the plans, anticipated the whole conversation of giving my notice, but still I was in knots about it. And by knots, I mean that I actually thought I had food poisoning! We ended up having to turn around once we got to Santa Barbara because I had gotten so sick at a restaurant that my boyfriend said it looked like my “soul was drained from my body”. It was not a good look on me.[

Although my anxiety and nerves had taken over, I was not to be deterred. I sat down with my boss that Monday and told him I was leaving. He received the news really well, and gave me an incredible opening: _if you give us one more month, I’ll let you change your mind._

Deal.

## In that month, I decided to do at least one thing everyday towards my new business.

I created plans, lists, and did a LOT of research. This commitment to forge through truly gave me the confidence to stick to my guns. It also gave me the space to see if I was serious about this, even on days when I thought fear of the unknown/going irreparably broke may actually kill me.

## Some of the things I did:

*   Register my domain name and get my email set up
*   Make and order business cards
*   Get a logo designed
*   Researched websites and designs
*   Made a three-tiered outreach list
*   Attempted a business plan
*   Researched competition
*   Searched trademarks
*   Read case studies
*   Created a mini marketing plan

## Some of the things I felt:

*   Excited
*   Refreshed
*   Inspired
*   Creative
*   Doubtful
*   Exhausted
*   Unsure
*   Fearful
*   Overwhelmed
*   Confused

I knew I would have to be strong to make this major leap into a successful flight as opposed to a free fall, and I’m glad I had the discipline to push through. Often we are our own barriers, so setting up goals that can pull us along can really help.

At the end of the month, I had all the pieces in place to start reaching out to my network, which, for me, felt like step one. Two years later, I’m rocking and rolling! I may be ready for a new logo and site, but that is all a part of the process. My former boss is now a mentor, and whenever I feel defeated I hear my husband’s voice saying, **_“being able to stomach the ups and downs of entrepreneurship is the hardest part. If you can handle that, you can handle the rest of it. Keep going.”_**
