<h2><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_7128-1024x683.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5277" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_7128-1024x683.jpg" alt="IMG_7128-1024x683" width="700" height="467" /></a>I was so nervous to quit my &ldquo;real job&rdquo; and start my consulting business that I made myself physically ill.</h2><br />
I was driving up to Santa Barbara with my boyfriend (now husband) for a wedding and it was 3 days before I was going to be with talking to my CEO and giving him the news. I had run through all the plans, anticipated the whole conversation of giving my notice, but still I was in knots about it. And by knots, I mean that I actually thought I had food poisoning! We ended up having to turn around once we got to Santa Barbara because I had gotten so sick at a restaurant that my boyfriend said it looked like my &ldquo;soul was drained from my body&rdquo;. It was not a good look on me.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baylie.jpg"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Although my anxiety and nerves had taken over, I was not to be deterred. I sat down with my boss that Monday and told him I was leaving. He received the news really well, and gave me an incredible opening: <em>if you give us one more month, I&rsquo;ll let you change your mind. </em></p>
<p>Deal.</p>
<h2>In that month, I decided to do at least one thing everyday towards my new business.</h2><br />
I created plans, lists, and did a LOT of research. This commitment to forge through truly gave me the confidence to stick to my guns. It also gave me the space to see if I was serious about this, even on days when I thought fear of the unknown/going irreparably broke may actually kill me.</p>

<h2>Some of the things I did:</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Register my domain name and get my email set up</li>
<li>Make and order business cards</li>
<li>Get a logo designed</li>
<li>Researched websites and designs</li>
<li>Made a three-tiered outreach list</li>
<li>Attempted a business plan</li>
<li>Researched competition</li>
<li>Searched trademarks</li>
<li>Read case studies</li>
<li>Created a mini marketing plan</li><br />
</ul></p>
<h2>Some of the things I felt:</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Excited</li>
<li>Refreshed</li>
<li>Inspired</li>
<li>Creative</li>
<li>Doubtful</li>
<li>Exhausted</li>
<li>Unsure</li>
<li>Fearful</li>
<li>Overwhelmed</li>
<li>Confused</li><br />
</ul><br />
I knew I would have to be strong to make this major leap into a successful flight as opposed to a free fall, and I&rsquo;m glad I had the discipline to push through. Often we are our own barriers, so setting up goals that can pull us along can really help.</p>

 At the end of the month, I had all the pieces in place to start reaching out to my network, which, for me, felt like step one. Two years later, I&rsquo;m rocking and rolling! I may be ready for a new logo and site, but that is all a part of the process. My former boss is now a mentor, and whenever I feel defeated I hear my husband&rsquo;s voice saying,  <strong><em style="line-height: 1.5;">&ldquo;being able to stomach the ups and downs of entrepreneurship is the hardest part. If you can handle that, you can handle the rest of it. Keep going.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
