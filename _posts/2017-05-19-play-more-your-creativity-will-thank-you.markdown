<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How often have you sacrificed rest, play, and relationships to get ahead in your creative endeavor? For me</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the answer is</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a lot.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first year in business, I hustled - <em>hard</em>. In some regards I enjoyed working four jobs, pulling 80 hour weeks, and living on pure adrenaline and caffeine. I prided myself in saying no to friend hangouts and girls nights, passing up weekend trips to see my family, and not having&nbsp;time for play. My business was growing, my head was down, my hands were working, my life was crammed to the max. But my heart longed for more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At <a href="http://yellowco.co/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Yellow Conference</a> last August I realized how much I had put my relationships on autopilot, and how little time I'd given to&nbsp;simply enjoying life. Finally, I had space to play. An excuse to let go. My team and I explored Los Angeles, met inspiring women, and soaked up every ounce of wisdom and wonder from the speakers. I came home full of vibrancy and thought, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;This is what it means to feel alive. More of this, please."</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since August, I have made a point to cut out the excess in my life. To live on a little less, making room in my life for play and exploration. I have invested&nbsp;myself into my closest friendships, and opened myself up to exploring what sets my soul on fire.&nbsp;And in doing so, I realized something pretty huge.</span></p>
<h3><b>Creativity flourishes&nbsp;from living fully alive, openly&nbsp;expressed, and allowing your soul to play. </b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In making space for my creativity to expand, my work has become inspired. The words I write flow with passion, and the clients I serve get a light-hearted, life-filled coach!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're feeling stuck, burned out, or like your life has become a&nbsp;hamster wheel of work-eat-sleep-work, then I urge you to&nbsp;live more alive.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, it <em>is</em> the whole point.</span></p>

<h3><b>Discover your essentials. </b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Get clear on what matters most! What do you need to fill your inspiration cup? Do you need adequate time outside? Maybe what fuels you is a weekly girls night, a daily workout, or a quarterly weekend trip to refresh. Find your essentials and put pen to paper. Make them happen. When you know what gives you energy and feels like play,&nbsp;you have a tangible, go-to solution&nbsp;when you feel creatively empty.</span></p>
<h3><b>Remove what drains you. </b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If all the projects you have&nbsp;committed to leave you stressed and burnt out, this could be a signal&nbsp;to let some things go. When the idea of a task brings you more joy than actually doing it, when you leave a meeting in a bad mood, or if you feel depleted at the end of your work week, girl, honor your energy and give yourself a break. You can't&nbsp;create space to play without cutting something out first.&nbsp;But once you do, joy will find you.</span></p>
<h3><b>Commit to living fully expressed. </b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there hidden parts of yourself begging&nbsp;to be expressed? Creativity waiting to be unleashed? Ideas that want to come to life? Relationships wanting to be fully known and loved? Commit to them. Give&nbsp;less of yourself to what takes life from you,&nbsp;and more of yourself to what is life-giving. Think spaciousness. Room to expand, enjoy,&nbsp;and explore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can certainly be scary to cut back. We are so accustomed to thinking that more is more. But I promise allowing room in your life for play will let your creativity flourish. It is the only way to fully bloom&nbsp;into the heights you were made for.</span></p>
