<p> Late one bloodshot night I nearly threw in the freelance towel.  I had become resentful of the self-employed life. I felt the inner rebel in me shouting out against the constant need to self-promote, the repetitive five-step webinars, and the ironic captivity of managing my own time. I found myself two hours into scrolling through LinkedIn job postings, wondering why I gave up the enticing stability of a nine to five job.</p>
<p> Then, I remembered a conversation I had five years ago. Being the hippie that my mom is, she was telling me about the four stages of the spiritual journey.  </p>
<ul>
<li> Blind Acceptance and Conformity to Status Quo </li>
<li> Questioning and Skepticism </li>
<li> Rebellion Against Status Quo </li>
<li> Rediscovering an Authentic Path </li><br />
</ul><br />
 Cue my light-bulb moment. </p>
<h3><strong>The entrepreneur&rsquo;s journey is a journey of the spirit.</strong></h3><br />
 The difference being that when I left the corporate world to pursue a career in coaching, I immediately entered stage one: Conformity. I conformed to the path my freelance mentors had taken. I copied their marketing strategies, their approach to coaching, and even their webinar templates.  </p>
<p> After getting the hang of the coaching world&rsquo;s status quo, I entered stage two: Questioning and Skepticism. Instead of blindly regurgitating my mentor&rsquo;s scripts, I asked myself, &ldquo;Is there a better way?&rdquo; I questioned my routines and procedures, and created my own style of working with clients. </p>
<p> Conformity and questioning were both safe stages that couldn&rsquo;t last too long. At some point last year, I slid, unprepared, into stage three: Rebellion. <strong>For the first time, I admitted every reason I was fed up with freelance life.</strong>  </p>

<p> No, I don&rsquo;t want to post spam-like Facebook ads.<br />
  No, I don&rsquo;t want to offer another five-step webinar.<br />
  No, I don&rsquo;t want to join one more cross-promotional Instagram opportunity.  </p>
<p> While I was rebelling against my unfulfilling daily routines, I interpreted my frustration as a reason to quit the entrepreneurial journey all together. I worried: I am not cut out for freelance, I need to get a &ldquo;real job.&rdquo; </p>
<p> I almost threw in the towel because I believed I had tried and failed at pursuing my authentic path. I didn&rsquo;t know that rebellion and frustration is a necessary step. I had left the corporate status quo for the freelance status quo, and now it was time to rebel and rediscover once again.  </p>
<p> Eight years ago, I sat in a corporate office surrounded by successful Manhattanites, and I rebelled. I rebelled against the nine to five and the eighty-hour work week spent achieving goals that meant nothing to me. That initial rebellion instigated my search for a more authentic path.  </p>
<p><strong>Now, I&rsquo;ve come full circle. Except, this time around, I&rsquo;m rebelling against the status quo within an industry I love.</strong> I still have frustration, but I have my dream job. Instead of throwing in the towel because of social media pressures and the headache of paying for my own benefits, I&rsquo;ll choose to notice what frustrates me and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p> I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you. Some days I resent the wander. I pray to arrive at a destination, to have all my systems in place, and money flowing in. But the truth in me knows that when that day comes, it won&rsquo;t last long. The creative in me will itch to rebel against my new norms. I&rsquo;ll grow tired of the programs I sell and marketing campaigns I write.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll begin the cycle again, questioning, rebelling, and launching into new phases of wandering and rediscovery.</p>
<h3><strong>When that day comes, I want to remember that the questions, frustrations, and belief that I am lost are all signs that I chose an authentic path, not a stagnant finish line.</strong></h3><br />
 For now, I feel privileged to follow a calling. I will honor my entrepreneurial journey, wandering into authentic expressions of norms that don&rsquo;t resonate with me. For now, I will embrace the wander. </p>
