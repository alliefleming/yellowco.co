<h2> Hey, <em>yes-woman! </em> </h2><br />
 Yeah, you. </p>
<p> Never thought of yourself that way? Me neither. Until recently, that is, when a coworker watched me struggle to cram another thing into my already-packed schedule and said, <em>&ldquo;Why are you killing yourself over this? It&rsquo;s not a big deal to say no,&rdquo;</em> and my immediate thought was a somewhat violent,  <strong><i>YES IT IS.</i></strong></p>
<p> &hellip;oh.  </p>
<p> From after-work events to birthday parties to house-sitting on the weekends, I found myself with a calendar that was filling up and a life that was spiraling out of control. I would never have called myself a people-pleaser, but gosh, was I really so afraid of offending people that I just couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to say no? How could I stop resigning myself to accept invitation that came my way, stretching myself way too thin in the process?<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ValerieDenisePhotos-39.jpg"><br />

<h2><em> Can you relate? If so, here are a few truths I&rsquo;ve had to confront before re-learning how to say no: </em></h2></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Being a yes-woman does not make you selfless.</b>  Nor does it make you a good friend, family member, girlfriend, etc. It actually makes you worse at giving of yourself, if you can believe it, because when you&rsquo;re not taking care of you, you can&rsquo;t take care of other people.&nbsp;  The other day, I was talking to a friend about all the things I&rsquo;d overcommitted to that week and how I had no idea how I would survive it. Finally, she interrupted,  <i> &ldquo;Girl, you know how flight attendants tell you to secure your own oxygen mask before helping other people with theirs?&rdquo;<br />
 </i><i> &ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; </i>  I answered. She gave me a pointed look.<br />
 <b>Being a yes-woman does not make you selfless.</b> <b>It makes you helpless.</b>  It strips you of your freedom be the best you can be at a few things, in the name of doing  <i><i> more. </i></i></p>
<p><b>So what do you do? </b> Before saying yes, take a deep breath and exhale a <em>&ldquo;Can I get back to you?&rdquo;</em> or a <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it and let you know.&rdquo;</em> Then ask yourself the hard question: why do I want to do this? Is it the appeal of the thing itself? Is it to help someone I care about? Is it because I need validation <em>(ouch)</em>? Is it because it makes me feel like a martyr <em>(double ouch)</em>?&nbsp; Think about the why behind your answer. Then decide.</li></p>
<li><b>Being a yes-woman does not make you fearless. </b> I used to think that by saying yes to everything, I could become the kind of person I always wanted to be; the brave one, no experience too difficult or too scary to handle. You want me to take on another project in addition to the ten I&rsquo;m already juggling? I&rsquo;ve got this. You want me to go where, to do what, for how long? Sure. At least it&rsquo;ll be an adventure, right?&nbsp; Somewhere along the way, I decided I had something to prove to myself, and my yes-syndrome became my crutch. <strong><strong><em>It&rsquo;s taken me years to learn that turning down an opportunity because I simply cannot do everything, does not make me weak.</em></strong></strong>
<p><b>So, what's the solution? </b> If &ldquo;no&rdquo; has become a monster in your life, you might need to shift the way you think about it.  <em><b>It takes valor to politely decline.</b> </em><b><em>It takes courage to face potential conflict</em>. </b> But you are not obligated to everything, so rather than wallowing in guilt the next time you decline an invitation, celebrate the victory you&rsquo;ve won in taking ownership of your life. Saying no does not mean you&rsquo;re less than; it means you recognize the  <i> value </i>   of your time and energy. Which leads me to&hellip;  </li></p>
<li><b>Being a yes-woman will&nbsp;not make you happy. </b>  Over the past several years, I have come to realize that I am happiest when I make time to recharge, relax, press pause for long enough to enjoy simply being obligation-free. It&rsquo;s not a luxury &ndash; it&rsquo;s a necessity. Who&rsquo;s going to protect your time if you don&rsquo;t?  I asked myself that question earlier this year. 2016 has been one of the craziest years of my life, so about a month ago, I had to make a new rule: <em>I will reserve one night per week to be kind to my introverted self.</em> My roommate calls this <em>No Company Mondays,</em> meaning I come home from work, make myself dinner, read a book, maybe journal, watch a TV show, and go to bed early. No company. No obligations. Just me.&nbsp; Being a yes-woman has a funny way of filling our schedules to overflowing. If you&rsquo;re reading this and thinking,  <i> I don&rsquo;t have a fear of saying no,  </i> it&rsquo;s possible that you don&rsquo;t. Maybe you have a fear of being still.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ValerieDenisePhotos-38.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6229" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/ValerieDenisePhotos-38.jpg" alt="Yellow Co. Blog: Stop being a yes woman" width="700" height="467" /></a> <b>So, what now? </b> Make a list of everything that answers the question  <b><i>&ldquo;What brings me joy?&rdquo;</i></b>  Consider the times when you feel like you&rsquo;re the best version of yourself. Is it when you&rsquo;re going out of your way to serve someone else? Is it when you&rsquo;re surrounded by other people? Is it when you&rsquo;ve taken a day off from seeing anybody? How much do you actually know about what your heart needs to be at peace? If you need a reason to guard your time, remember that if you don&rsquo;t do it, no one else will. </li><br />
</ol><br />
 As with most things in life, undoing our yea-saying tendencies takes time and balance and patience. It&rsquo;s okay if that looks different for you than it does for me, but my hope for both of us is that one day, when someone says,  <i> &ldquo;Hey, yes-woman,&rdquo;  </i> we won&rsquo;t even glance up. </p>
