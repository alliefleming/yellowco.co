<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was feeling a little guilty. I&rsquo;d worked so hard to get where I am, but now there was somewhere else I wanted to go. An old friend&rsquo;s stinging words flashed back into my mind and nagged at my heart, <strong>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you </strong></span><strong><i>ever</i></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> be content?!&rdquo;</strong> But the truth is, I still am. I've realized in entrepreneurship, it's okay to want to move on to the next destination, as long as you give your all to your current home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some people are built for lots and lots stability, consistency, and predictability. Although I believe we all need at least a little of these things in different seasons and unique doses - some of&nbsp;us thrive on wild ideas, adding to existing&nbsp;plans, and seeing where that next phase takes us. <em>Entrepreneurial wandering</em>, if you will. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite what it may seem on the surface, I don&rsquo;t think this trait means we are irresponsible or discontent. It doesn&rsquo;t mean we are&nbsp;pinballs, forcefully springing decisions into a crazy life of sporadic turns.</span></p>
<h3><strong>I believe it means we are continually unlocking pieces of our minds and hearts that deserve space and time to breathe, at the exact moment&nbsp;they are meant to come to life.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I've had my fair share of this. I moved from Wisconsin, to California, to Africa, and back to California again. I went from working for others, to starting a photography business, to starting a coaching business, to starting a personal blog. (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Good God, woman... can&rsquo;t you just make up your mind?!</em>)&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, each of these seasons, places, and job titles, they&rsquo;ve built off of each other. Because that&rsquo;s how it works. Each piece gives me what I need at the time, and uncovers more of who I am in preparation&nbsp;for where&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve yet to go. </span></p>
<p>That said, I think it is super important to give our all to where we&rsquo;re at, even if we know it&rsquo;s not where we&rsquo;ll stay. I&rsquo;ve seen, time and time again, that when I&rsquo;m intentional with what I&rsquo;ve been given, the next stepping stone rises up naturally. <strong>This is&nbsp;the way I want to forge my path: organically, easily, at the perfect time.</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, even though I&rsquo;m currently living in a season I worked so hard to get to (being a business coach), I&rsquo;m also on the verge of newness and more change (adopting from China and working on my book about infertility). Sometimes the in-between gets uncomfortable, but I&rsquo;m determined to explore every nook and cranny of this time&nbsp;and I hope you&rsquo;ll do the same, alongside me, wherever you&rsquo;re at.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>5 ways to make the in-between meaningful:</strong></h3></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Never let anything fall through the cracks. Opportunities for new adventures are awesome, but the responsibilities of your current endeavors should take&nbsp;priority.</span></p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Give yourself consistent, dedicated time to work on the new stuff. Do not suppress your ideas - <em>let that creativity out</em>. Maybe this means you set aside Friday afternoons to start, since most of us usually spend that time scrolling or procrastinating anyway ;).</span></p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Celebrate this current phase. Think about how much brain power, time, and possibly tears that have gone into this perfect place you currently call a home, job title, etc. Acknowledge the work you put in to get here. Let it sit and settle. It will help you feel less antsy for the newness of what&rsquo;s to come.</span></p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Reflect on and write out every way this current season has added goodness to your life. How can you take these lessons and apply them to what&rsquo;s next?</span></p></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Be proactive, but not pushy. We only have control over so much, so remember that whatever is to come will happen when it&rsquo;s supposed to happen. Create your own opportunities, build relationships, be kind and encouraging to yourself, knowing that the next stone </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rise up, when it should.</span></p><br />
