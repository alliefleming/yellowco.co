<p>Hi everyone! I&rsquo;m Corina, and i&rsquo;m a graphic and jewelry designer and blogger (lots on my plate!) My husband and i are currently living on the beautiful Greek Island Kefalonia with our two babies, our husky Bella, and a tuxedo cat Shrek.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get started doing what you do?</strong></p>
<p>Basically i studied architectural design, but after college, i felt that my heart belonged to graphic design. I took a few online lessons, and that&rsquo;s when i started my blog. Good taste and aesthetics, is not something that someone can just teach you. But having a blog pushed me to get inspired and be creative in order to evolve my own taste and style.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSC03004.jpg"><img style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;" alt="SONY DSC" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/DSC03004.jpg" width="700" height="946" /></a>What drives and motivates you?</strong></p>
<p>My love for what i do. The feeling i get when i create something. The need to make something beautiful, a way to express my ideas and emotions.</p>
<p><strong>What does your creative process look like?</strong></p>
<p>So organized! Being organised is what inspires me even more. Most of the times, i get my best ideas a few minutes before i sleep - they say that this is the most creative moment in your day. I note down my ideas, and the next day i sketch, experiment, and work on them.</p>
<p><strong>What does a typical day look like for you?</strong></p>
<p>Waking up at 8, tidying up the house, walking Bella by the lake, breakfast, yoga and by 9 i&rsquo;m in my office working. Short break for lunch at 1:30, and then finish work - leave computer by 5. Walk the dog, relax, work on personal projects, and a movie at night.</p>
<p><strong>What makes you feel alive?</strong></p>
<p>Being surrounded by nature. Usually amongst the woods, breathing fresh air, discovering secret paths.</p>

<p>Like above, i&rsquo;ll say the nature. Especially now that summer&rsquo;s here, being at the beach, laying in the sun and on sand. The colours our island takes, blues, whites&nbsp;and lots of plants. I&rsquo;ve noticed how my style changes from season to season, and i guess that seasons do have a big affect on me.</p>

<p><strong>Advice for those just starting out in your industry?</strong></p>
<p>Be original, never forget the reason you do what you do, always push yourself to be better and create all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Current obsession?</strong><br />
They are so many! Ok, i&rsquo;ll say maxi dresses, and yoga necklaces and bracelets.</p>
<p><strong>Coffee or tea?</strong><br />
At the moment, cold tea! But when winter comes, i always say coffee :)</p>
<p><strong>Three things that make you happy.</strong><br />
Laying on the sun, walking in a summer&rsquo;s night with my husband, picnics.</p>
