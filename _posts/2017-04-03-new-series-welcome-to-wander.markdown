  content: So much of this speaks true to me.  It's hard when you are 30 something
    and trying to find your path in life still.  Not only for your own self but in
    society's view too.  You are to old to "not have your shit together". But I'm
    also to young to give up on the next 64 years of my life since I'm planning on
    living at least till I'm 100. ? Great post, thankyou.  Looking forward to the
    rest of the series.  :)

  content: I love this. (I've already binge watched all of Grace &amp; Frankie!) It
    speaks so true to me as I'm very comfortable where I'm at but where can I go/expand
    to be more adventurous or find my next challenge.

    happen when we need a change, and some we're thrown into. Thanks for reading Tina!!

    your life. Always moving and always learning new ways to grow, is my mantra for
    life. :))

  content: "Love the way you've depicted the nature of life and the way in which the
    socio-cultural and economic factors of our time have directly impacted the way
    in which we navigate our sense of self - what's our purpose, how do we do things
    we love, how do we make the most of experiences in our life. \nWhat's an incredible
    coincidence is that it's directly related to the purpose of myWONDR - a platform
    for life interests and ambitions - maybe there's a synergy here with the Wander
    series?"

  content: There should never be a time on getting your shit together, you get it
    together when you've got it together. Society loves to label everything and tell
    you how you should and shouldn't live your life. You're dead right Tracy, don't
    give up on even 1 year let alone the 64 ;)

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say self-discovery is for the youth. For the twenty-somethings grappling to just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">figure it out</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That time and age is a promise of when we will finally be settled into ourselves, and set in our ways. While I can&rsquo;t deny the confidence I see solidified with matured time, it would be a shame to limit shifting paths and evolving character to one demographic. From what I can tell, we are all continually answering the question:</span></p>
<h3><em><b>&ldquo;Where do I go from here?&rdquo;</b></em></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Not long ago I was introduced to, and in turn fell in love with, the Netflix series Grace &amp; Frankie. The story follows the everyday lives of two women in their seventies essentially restarting their lives as they both come out of divorce. One - a free-spirited hippie, the other - buttoned up and uptight. It is clever, and ridiculous, and rare circumstances aside, empathy inducing to the realities of an older generation. In time, they navigate starting a business at an age stereotyped for retirement, open up to exploring love again, and find true partnership in each other&rsquo;s friendship that before had consisted of mutual animosity. Fiction aside, their narrative is a true reminder that no matter our age or conditions, we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> find ourselves lost in places we have yet to walk through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we want to talk about it. For many of us, we get so caught up in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to take the next step forward, that we end up not moving at all. We want a clear cut, fool-proof guide on how to do xyz in life, and beg for answers to simply unanswerable questions.</span></p>
<h3><strong>But when we look at the core of what holds us back, is it really a &lsquo;how-to&rsquo; issue, or is it something more?</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it instead that we giving our fears more weight than our courage? Are we allowing our doubts to quickly cloud our faith? Do our insecurities speak louder than our confidence?&nbsp;</span>Has our focus shifted away from <i>why</i> - the heart of what we are trying to accomplish in the first place?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8302" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ValerieDenisePhotos-82.jpg" alt="Welcome to Wander - The Yellow Room" width="1024" height="683" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is, we cannot always give each other answers of what is to come. Instead, over these next three months, we want to address this time spent wandering in the middle. The in-between of trying to make it possible to leave your day job for your passion project. The search of not yet knowing your individual calling to make an impact. The indifference found in being too comfortable, in need of a push to your next adventure.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We believe that getting to the grit of what drives us will directly influence and awaken how we will get there.</strong></span></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, the time for this has never been better than now. Without question, we are in a time where our world is shifting. Voices are being lifted louder than ever. Dust is getting shaken. And the complacency many of us, myself included, had settled into is no longer an option for the very earth we live on, and every human we share it with. We are due to accept the challenge of taking an honest look at where we are, and exploring the intention of our actions now and going forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I encourage you to examine your purpose along with us. Hear the stories we&rsquo;ll share of women who know how it feels to be in the thick of it by name. Gather their words and wisdom on flourishing during this time. Find footing not just to move, but move in the direction of who you want to be. Welcome to Wander, I think you&rsquo;ll like it here.</span></p>
