<p>Summer is fully upon us. And so begins the season of long beach days,&nbsp;traveling far and wide, warm breezy evenings, and so much&nbsp;<em>sun</em>. It is truly my favorite time of the year. But with each summer comes a need for a few essentials. Ones to soothe our sun kissed skin and keep us hydrated. While it's tempting to want to pick up a cheap bathing suit, or grab a bottle of water from the grocery store, we have a growing responsibility to be conscious consumers. Thankfully, more and more companies are making this easy&nbsp;for us. These six summer essentials&nbsp;are made by brands who create ethically made products, give back, or use sustainable practices.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.memobottle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memobottle</a></h3><br />
This sleek, reusable, bpa-free water bottle fits easily into your bag, backpack, or even pocket for staying hydrated on the road. We actually featured them in our <a href="https://yellowco.myshopify.com/collections/empowerment-boxes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empowerment Boxes</a>&nbsp;this past quarter, and are huge fans. Plus, $1 from every online order is donated to  <a href="http://water.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">water.org</a>, who p rovides access to safe water for one person for 10 months.</p>

Hackwith Design House creates ethically made clothing and swimwear in their Minnesota studio. Most of their items are made to order in an effort to reduce waste and give exceptional attention to detail to each piece. I just purchased the <a href="http://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product/skinny-knot-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skinny Knot Top</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product/high-waisted-bottoms-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Waisted Bottoms</a>&nbsp;and let me tell you I am in&nbsp;<em>love</em>. The fabric is high quality and their designs are so flattering on a wide variety of body types.</p>
