Summer is fully upon us. And so begins the season of long beach days, traveling far and wide, warm breezy evenings, and so much _sun_. It is truly my favorite time of the year. But with each summer comes a need for a few essentials. Ones to soothe our sun kissed skin and keep us hydrated. While it's tempting to want to pick up a cheap bathing suit, or grab a bottle of water from the grocery store, we have a growing responsibility to be conscious consumers. Thankfully, more and more companies are making this easy for us. These six summer essentials are made by brands who create ethically made products, give back, or use sustainable practices.

### 1\. [Memobottle](https://www.memobottle.com/)

This sleek, reusable, bpa-free water bottle fits easily into your bag, backpack, or even pocket for staying hydrated on the road. We actually featured them in our [Empowerment Boxes](https://yellowco.myshopify.com/collections/empowerment-boxes) this past quarter, and are huge fans. Plus, $1 from every online order is donated to [water.org](http://water.org/), who p rovides access to safe water for one person for 10 months.

### 2\. [Hackwith Design House Swim](http://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product-category/apparel/swim/)

Hackwith Design House creates ethically made clothing and swimwear in their Minnesota studio. Most of their items are made to order in an effort to reduce waste and give exceptional attention to detail to each piece. I just purchased the [Skinny Knot Top](http://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product/skinny-knot-top/) and [High Waisted Bottoms](http://hackwithdesignhouse.com/product/high-waisted-bottoms-2/) and let me tell you I am in _love_. The fabric is high quality and their designs are so flattering on a wide variety of body types.

These lush, hand woven towels are made with 100% certified organic cotton and dyes for the softest summer luxury. Loom Towels products are sustainably and ethically made in a small Turkish community, celebrating their traditional craftsmanship weaving each product by hand on old shuttle-looms.
