Back in February we had an amazing 2-day weekend up in Santa Barbara at the airstream trailer park [Autocamp](http://autocamp.com/). We joined with some awesome #ladybosses who are working hard to make the best impact they can in their positions of leadership.

We stayed the weekend in these super cool renovated airstream trailers that Autocamp provides.

We had the incredible [Krysta Masciale](http://www.stilettosontherocks.com/) leading the group through her [START Goal Setting booklet](http://www.stilettosontherocks.com/shop/). Throughout the weekend, we took time to get real with each other, down and dirty with our fears and doubts, and the meaning of "impact".

We talked about what it means to redefine goals and set priorities, not only for our career, but for our life. Krysta asked us the tough question, _"What if we put as much effort into our personal lives as we do into our careers?"_

Krysta challenged us to take a good hard look at what we are struggling with, and to take the time to figure out what the the deeper issue is. It's amazing what can come up when you really start diving into an issue. It was a time of reflection and searching within ourselves. Getting to root issues is not an easy thing, and we were challenged.
