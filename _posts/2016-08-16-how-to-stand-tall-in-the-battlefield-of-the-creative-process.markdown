  content: This was a great read, and really resonated with me. Especially the idea
    of being honest, speaking the truth proactively even when it doesn't feel easy.
    As a person who sometimes sacrifices truth for being polite, I'm working on this
    one, and feel extra motivation now that I think about how critical this is to
    the creative process.

</a>I&rsquo;ve never been face-to-face with a lion...</span></em></h2><br />
I&rsquo;ve never faced anything that required very much courage, come to think of it. I&rsquo;ve never engaged in battle; I haven&rsquo;t been attacked by gunfire like Jennifer Garner in an old Alias rerun. I haven&rsquo;t even had to stand up to online bullies or mean girls at school.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s easy to see the stories of others who have overcome incredible obstacles and give due-credit to their valor: a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship has valor. A man who has fought a battle with cancer while maintaining a full-time job to provide for his family. A couple who has worked tirelessly with the foster care system to provide a loving home for someone else&rsquo;s children...I see these battles courageously fought and conquered, and I think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how does one develop this kind of courage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Is it only revealed in light of life-altering experiences, or can I develop it <em>now?</em> </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my lifetime, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of things I&rsquo;ve had to overcome, whether or not they seem&nbsp;like giants... </span></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the lion is right in front of you, whether or not it&rsquo;s an actual living, breathing animal. In college, finals week was my little lion. For some, it&rsquo;s a challenging familial relationship. For others, it&rsquo;s an anxiety disorder or a physical health battle. Sometimes, just the idea of Tuesday itself can be a lion.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_1988.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6693 size-full" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/MG_1988.jpg" alt="HOW TO STAND TALL IN THE BATTLEFIELD OF THE CREATIVE PROCESS" width="700" height="467" /></a></span><em><strong>So when you&rsquo;re faced with a pretty normal, roaring day, how do you choose to be a woman of valor? For me, it&rsquo;s in three small steps:</strong></em></p>
<p><b>Show Up:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Show up for work (on time). Show up to community events &mdash; yes, even if you&rsquo;re an introvert. Show up for friends and family who need you. Getting over yourself and developing tenacity now will benefit you as it becomes easier with practice.</span></p>
<p><b>Be Honest:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Proactively speak truth, even when it&rsquo;s difficult. It&rsquo;s harder to confront things head-on than it is to skirt around tough talks, but it&rsquo;s much more effective in the long run &mdash; and choosing to make honesty a habit can help smaller issues from growing into larger lions. Instead of avoiding the hard conversations, meet them with conviction (and kindness, of course). If you&rsquo;re honest in the day-to-day, it will be more natural to speak truth in a setting where much more is at stake.</span></p>
<p><b>Give It Your All:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In a lion&rsquo;s den, you wouldn&rsquo;t avoid the animal because you were afraid of it, would you? You might be able to hide behind a rock for a bit, but ultimately, there&rsquo;d be no chance for survival. Think of your daily battles the same way. Stand up to them with lion-like courage, and fight until you&rsquo;ve overcome each one. When a larger beast comes your way, you&rsquo;ll have confidence that you&rsquo;ve conquered baby cubs &mdash; and certainly, you can face a lion, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
