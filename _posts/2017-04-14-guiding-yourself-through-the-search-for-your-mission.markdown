<p>It took me two years and almost giving up my own company to finally recognize the deeper purpose behind my work.<b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before then, I was only sure of two things I wanted: to help businesses give back by partnering with charities, and to assist others in creating meaning in their lives. But, it was never clear to me </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I was so motivated to do that, and what the core of that mission would be.</span></p>
<p><b>The importance of finding our ultimate purpose is because it keeps us grounded when at times we feel we have lost our ambition.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when you start a dream business and are flying high on being a girl-boss, the burn out can sneak up on you. Heck, I get to help make magic happen and change lives each day, but incredible as it is - I have days spent thinking, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t talk to one more charity. I can&rsquo;t help one more person. I&rsquo;m just done.&rdquo; I am not proud of those moments, but what pulls me through them is knowing that I have a deeper intention motivating me every day. That tomorrow, I will wake up again in hot pursuit of that same inner calling. For me, that purpose is helping leaders realize their dreams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately discovering this was certainly not easy. There was a process I followed to the uncovering of it all that I hope will help you along your search too:</span></p>
<h3><b>Give yourself time for the pattern behind your purpose to reveal itself.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I took the approach of making a continuous list of answers to the question, &ldquo;what else can you do that may work in the direction of your dream?&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t stop until the list ends, and challenge yourself when it does.&nbsp;Keep adding to it indefinitely.</span></p>

<h3><b>Allow yourself to be abstract.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Broad missions are still real missions. Mine is about helping people live their dreams, and I know how general and abstract it is, but in fact, it&rsquo;s a good thing. This broadness allows me to take so many different directions. Whether it&rsquo;s via my company or something else, as long as it moves me&nbsp;towards this goal, then it will be something that feels meaningful to me. There is no right answer for how you pursue purpose &ndash; it&rsquo;s a vision and feeling that you focus on, and go after.</span></p>
<h3><b>Know that your purpose can change.</b></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, why you do what you do may change as you change. I thought I wanted to help people when I started my business, and then I realized that it was less about just being helpful and more about making a big picture dream become tangible. The more I wander towards this, the more I have been able to shape my message and bring on clients that jive with my goal. It is exactly what refinement is for - the constant little tweaks that make you and your business better and better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you journey through the process of uncovering what you&rsquo;re meant to do, go easy on yourself. I know firsthand how damaging it is to hold yourself to permanence and legalistic standards that put you in a box (hello, I&rsquo;m extremely Type A). Life is just not this way though. We grow and change, which is precisely what the theme of Wander is all about - search and discovery. It means learning, getting lost, and being flexible along the way. You&rsquo;ll land just where you need to be.</span></p>
