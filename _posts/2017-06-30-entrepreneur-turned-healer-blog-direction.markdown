<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was born bold, as many children in the eighties were. We believed we could do anything, and rightly so. As a tween I struggled to decide between becoming a Broadway Star (hear me roar!) or a Defense Attorney (I was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good at arguing my point).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ended up an entrepreneur turned healer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In&nbsp;my early twenties, I became increasingly agitated with my then career. I had a deep feeling that there was something more life had&nbsp;to offer me, but I had no idea what it was. I lived in a paradigm that left me feeling like a foreigner, and I did my best to adapt.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My roll-up-those-sleeves attitude landed me as a partner in a denim store and clothing line right out of college. But, I was broke, so I started doing freelance graphic design work for people I would meet at the coffee shop I also worked at.</span></p>
<h3><strong>I was 22, running three businesses with no experience aside from an inherited hustle mentality.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years in, I took a step back and realized that I wasn&rsquo;t doing anything that felt important or meaningful to me. I became determined to uncover my calling. Every hint of inspiration became pages&nbsp;full of ideas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After almost two years of thinking, &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s this! Oh no, maybe it&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; I decided that trying to figure it out was clearly not working. So, I came to the conclusion that I should just start writing about this search I was on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From one brainstorming session came&nbsp;a name for this blog: Pushing Beauty. Once I had a name, I knew I just needed to start. It didn&rsquo;t need to be grand. I didn&rsquo;t know where it was going to take me. I just had to get this feeling out into the world somehow.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though I had never called myself a writer, I was one, and so I began writing.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8953 size-full" title="ENTREPRENEUR TURNED HEALER: HOW STARTING A BLOG SHIFTED MY DIRECTION - THE YELLOW ROOM" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1T5A6791.jpg" alt="ENTREPRENEUR TURNED HEALER: HOW STARTING A BLOG SHIFTED MY DIRECTION - THE YELLOW ROOM" width="5760" height="3840" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, the blog did not blow up. This is not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> story. But it gave me a voice. It helped move the energy that felt stuck. It made me feel excited, and it sent a message that this was important to me.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I took the pressure off Pushing Beauty to be this huge&nbsp;idea, it started to feel more fluid. My expression came up easier. I began to write for other blogs and gained a small following. Still, I had no idea how to turn it into a&nbsp;business, and wasn&rsquo;t clear what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was aside from a blog.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, a while later, I found myself lying on a table in a studio in Santa Monica, breathing. I wouldn&rsquo;t recognize for another year that what I experienced in that moment would become my calling. As&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I began to practice Breathwork, my life transformed. The relationships that were holding me back cleared out, I felt more connected to my body, and most importantly, I learned what it really meant to love myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when everything was coming together for me, I read a book called, &ldquo;I Can See Clearly Now&rdquo; by Dr. Wayne Dyer. The puzzle pieces were starting to take form. I realized that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was looking for before, because I hadn&rsquo;t yet learned what I am meant&nbsp;to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no more guessing what Pushing Beauty might be. It&nbsp;was clearly an expression of me, but it was also my ability to help people heal and transform their lives. The more I grew&nbsp;as a person, the clearer my mission&nbsp;became.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mind loves to try to figure things out on its own. And it will continue to do so endlessly until you choose to surrender.</span></p>

<h3><strong>When we release the need to control the outcome, we allow the magic to come in. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">So just start. Wherever you are, starting is the first step. Start the thing that feels most intuitive to you. The thing that feels like a big <em>yes</em>&nbsp;in your body.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&rsquo;t worry about what your mind has to say. It will poke holes and&nbsp;keep you stuck forever worrying about the how-to's. The truth is, that our minds are most concerned about you being safe. It wants to protect you from failing, from acting like a fool, and from messing up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But - that&rsquo;s exactly what we&nbsp;have to do to succeed. Release the idea everything must be&nbsp;lined up and perfectly executed. That&rsquo;s the energy that keeps us frozen, and it&rsquo;s the biggest misconception there is. No one who has done anything remarkable has ever done it perfectly. The sooner you allow the process to be messy, the more fun you&rsquo;re going to have on your journey. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because remember, this part in the middle is&nbsp;where our story is at.</span></p>
