<p>We spend a good amount of&nbsp;time on our search for self worth. Whether it&rsquo;s struggling to search for the right group to fit into during our crazy high school years, or the world-opening moment we graduate from college, our journey always resurfaces, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in an Asian family, I was taught by my parents that my self worth was found in everything thing I did. Academics, work, chores, church - you name it! I grew up questioning my worth on an almost daily basis. The older I got, the more I became aware of myself as a person, and allowed my personal experiences to shape the person I am today. But because of how I was raised, my struggles with my self worth seep out from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of my adult life, I found my self worth through my work. I spent the majority of my time (around 40 or so hours a week) here, whether it was editing magazine articles or entering the budget for the new school year.</span></p>
<h3><strong>My identity became so engrained into my work that I took any success or failure personally. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">How I valued myself was dependent on how I was perceived by others. Welcome to the life of a people pleaser. But j</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ust weeks before I turned 27, my husband and I found out we were pregnant. I knew that becoming a mom would drastically change my life in all directions, but I failed to measure how much it would affect my self worth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Later that year, my husband and I welcomed a healthy baby boy. Within a few months, we decided it was better financially for me to quit my job and become a stay-at-home mom. I found myself struggling to find who I was as a mom in this transition. I was quick to compare myself to other SAHMs, to moms on social media, and even to unrealistic versions of moms I created in my head. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After almost a full year into motherhood, we decided it was best to move closer to family, meaning&nbsp;I would now need to go back to working full-time. The final months of being a stay-at-home mom were closing in, and I knew it would be much harder to transition back to work. But, I stayed positive and hopeful for my family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My&nbsp;first three weeks entering back into the workforce were the worst. For the first time, I entered into an identity crisis. I had worked so hard to be content as a mom, and suddenly adding a full time job to the mix made this far more difficult. One day at work, I was sitting in the bathroom stall, staring at old pictures of my son, and my heart dropped to my stomach. I missed him so much. Guilt, sadness, and anxiety arose with in me. Thoughts of not feeling worthy emerged, and I allowed them to consume me for the rest of the day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started reflecting on&nbsp;the days I was obsessed about my worth and how others would view me. I remembered how much of a mental and physical toll it took on me - sleepless nights, feeling anxious around others, being constantly disappointed at myself, etc. So much of this&nbsp;tension was confronting me again in this new transition. In figuring out who I now was as a working mom. In being caught in the angst of two completely new stages of life combining in an instant.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked to my husband that night, and it was almost as if I reached another revelation in my life.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Being imperfect is part of the human experience. We are not defined by what we do, but who we are.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I needed to stop comparing myself to others and focus more on the person I wanted to be for my family. Realizing that my worth extends beyond motherhood&nbsp;and my career opened up and released a lot of my inner&nbsp;conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new season continues to stretch me in many ways, and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. I&rsquo;m learning to appreciate the person I am, finding worth in it, and shifting my perspective during&nbsp;the ebb and flow of transition.&nbsp;</span></p>
