<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7580" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-54.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-54" width="700" height="467" /></a><em>In starting a business, one of my saddest struggles has been yearning for a role model and a mentor that embodies the type of person I want to be: a mother, an entrepreneur, a wife, and spiritual. </em></span></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I want all components of that to be folded in together, and damn...it&rsquo;s hard. Logically, I look to find other women I can follow and turn to for guidance, but sadly there are few ladies waiting in the wings to encourage and choreograph this dance I&rsquo;ve decided to perform. </span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s arrogant of me to think I&rsquo;m the only one, because it&rsquo;s just not true. At times I thought I needed to give some of things on my list up because if other women couldn&rsquo;t do it, then there&rsquo;s no way I could! But, I have continued to press on and discover there is a world out there of women doing just what I am, and some. They just may not define themselves the way I do, they are in fact very busy (obviously), and sometimes they aren&rsquo;t in my immediate circle.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7581" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-55.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-55" width="700" height="467" /></a>I have been on the hunt for these women for a while now, and if you are reading this and thinking, <em>&ldquo;THAT&rsquo;S ME!!&rdquo;</em>, then <a href="http://www.abelimpact.com/contact/" target="_blank">email me immediately.</a> Otherwise, when looking for a mentor, I have some tips:</p>
<p><strong>Define what you want</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I clearly defined what I wanted to be: <em>mom, entrepreneur, wife, spiritual.</em> These are the most important elements of my life and I want them all to coexist. There are a lot of other things, but they don&rsquo;t make the list because I don&rsquo;t find them as important. Other things include yogi, cook, dog-mom, daughter, manager, etc., and while I love all those roles, they sometimes take a backseat. Define who you want to be/are and go from there. </span></p>
<p><strong>Challenge your beliefs</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had this disturbing and deep rooted belief that if I wanted to run a successful business I would probably have a bad marriage. I hadn&rsquo;t seen a lot of other people do this balance well, so figured it wasn&rsquo;t a real thing. I realized that was a belief I had and now challenge it (among others) daily. Your priorities will dictate what is successful in your life and as long as I am open about that, I find that my big fears and negative beliefs have no legs to stand on.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-55.jpg"><br />
</a> </span></p>
<p><strong>Decide how you will prioritize</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since priorities do determine a lot of your success, make them. For me personally, I cherish my relationships more than work and would rather suffer financially than interpersonally. If I find that work is impeding on my marriage, I cut back. I&rsquo;ve been broke before, and it didn&rsquo;t kill me. No judgment if you&rsquo;re in hustle mode, going after the big bucks. People will have to sometimes bend with you as much as you bend with them. There are seasons for all of it.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-52.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7583" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ValerieDenisePhotos-52.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-52" width="700" height="467" /></a> </span></p>
<p><strong>Start asking people for introductions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best way to find great mentors is to ask people you know for an introduction. In all meetings you should be asking the person you&rsquo;re sitting with what their biggest needs are. That&rsquo;s just a life tip. When the question comes back to you, be ready. Tell them who you&rsquo;re looking for so you can start to meet some people with like-minds. </span></p>
<p><strong>Make friends online</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have totally met people in person who started as friends from online groups &ndash; it sounds weird even to write that down, but it&rsquo;s true! <em>P.S.: no cat-fishing allowed.</em> I have taken branding courses, and am in some female entrepreneur groups (typically there&rsquo;s a Facebook group) and when you see women in there that you vibe with, send them a direct message or ask if you can email them with some questions. Put yourself out there and actually participate online. You&rsquo;d be surprised by how fast you can cultivate friendships and find there are tons of people out there just like you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Friend, you are not alone. Anything that&rsquo;s tugging at your heart is worth pursuing. Sometimes you just have to search extra hard to find the diamond in the coal mine.</span></p>
