<h2>January. It's January.</h2><br />
What does that bring up for you? Is it exciting? A new planner, <a href="http://www.stilettosontherocks.com/shop/" target="_blank">new goals to make,</a>&nbsp;the start of Spring cleaning (out with the old, in with the new), capsule-closeting, and fool-proof work out regimens.</p>
<p>Maybe it looks a little different for you; I know this New Year has come way too fast, but feeling like it's slugging along at same time. The week between Christmas and NYE consisted of a house (yes, my whole family of 4) getting the stomach flu, way too many Gilmore Girls episodes, and pure exhaustion that I can't tell is brought on by overwork or feeling too anxious about what this next year holds (it's that "I can't even" kind of tired, you feel me?).</p>
<p>Whether you're ready to Get It Girl or slow sippin' your cup o' inspiration this morning, I'm stoked on this next series for not only you, but me, and the Yellow Co. as we all have areas to grow in motivation, and small&nbsp;biz development.</p>
<p>This series will be taking us beyond keeping our heads barely above the water. We want to empower you to dive deeper, pick up one of those sinking colorful sticks at the bottom of the pool, and come back up with air in your lungs to spare.<strong> We want to help you achieve, not just imagine, your dreams.</strong></p>
<h2>We want to help you <strong>BUILD your business</strong>.</h2><br />
Whether you just have an idea, a successful business, you're a soloprenuer, or you're working full time and pursuing your passion project on the side, we want to help you gain focus and BUILD. We know that ideas are fun, easy and great. But execution and knowing the next steps to take is the hard part. The fact is, in order to make real change in the world, we need to know the next steps to take.</p>
