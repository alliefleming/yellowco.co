</a>Snapchat&rsquo;s been getting lots of buzz lately, and it isn&rsquo;t just for teens anymore.</h2><br />
Snapchat video traffic <em>(7 BILLION videos/day)</em> is catching up to Facebook. Cosmopolitan, National Geographic, Refinery 29, and CNN all have accounts.</p>
<h2>Even The White House is snapping, people!</h2><br />
Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking, &lsquo;Great, <em>another</em> social platform&rsquo;. &lsquo;<em>Another</em> thing on my to-the-moon-and-back to-do list&rsquo;. <em>I hear you!</em> But I&rsquo;d encourage you not to look at Snapchat as another obligation. It&rsquo;s an <strong>opportunity</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s why:</em></p>
<p>If you are a creative entrepreneur or freelancer, your business will benefit from being an early adapter. Strike BEFORE the iron is hot.</p>
<p>I overwhelmingly hear that Instagram is the most impactful platform for creatives at the moment, but it <strong>will</strong> become less relevant one day, and your business <strong>will</strong> need to adapt.</p>
<p>When there are less people on a platform, there&rsquo;s less competition, and the folks putting out consistent, valuable content can gain traction quickly.</p>
<p><em>This</em> is that moment for Snapchat. You can resist, or jump on board, give it what you got, and possibly let it become a game changer in your business.</p>

</a>If you&rsquo;re looking for ideas on how to use Snapchat as a creative entrepreneur or brand, here are 10 things to consider:</strong></h2></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Treat it as a marketing tool.</strong> Curate your content. Be personal, but stay on brand. Give a tour of your workroom; introduce your team; get viewers&rsquo; opinions on new products; share relevant stories or advice.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> Think of it as a vlog.</strong> Snapchat is a way to bring your audience along with you through the day. It gives them a behind the scenes look at the real personality of your brand and lets viewers connect on a new level.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> Share valuable content.</strong> Whatever content you&rsquo;re good at delivering&mdash;education, encouragement, entertainment, etc.&mdash;share that to your Snapchat story as a mini blog. Here is a genius example: Danielle Bernstein of <a href="http://weworewhat.com/" target="_blank">We Wore What</a> recently snapped a &lsquo;music morning&rsquo;, where she took a video her iPod playing a track with the album artwork on the screen. As viewers watched the 10-second clip, she invited them to take a screenshot. She went through a handful of her current favorite songs. Brilliant!</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Repurpose your most popular blog posts. </strong>How can you translate your best content to Snapchat? Share your most-loved posts in a new, engaging, and interesting way.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Do it your way. </strong>You don&rsquo;t necessarily have to speak or be on camera. You can take photographs, silent clips, or use the caption and pen tools to engage.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Get creative. </strong>Set a timer for 10 minutes and write down all the different ways you could use video content for your biz. How can you break down those ideas into 10-second bites for killer content on Snapchat?</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong> Have a daily or weekly theme.</strong> If you&rsquo;re a fashion blogger or stylist, do a look of the day. Shoot yourself in the mirror, breaking down every piece of clothing you&rsquo;re wearing. Illustrator? Do a daily doodle. Food blogger? Cook + share a weekly recipe. Life coach? Share a daily mantra or affirmation.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong> Use Snapchat to up your public speaking game.</strong> After a couple months I became much more comfortable and confident in my speaking skills. You can also use Snapchat to gain attention from local businesses and conferences that may invite you to speak.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong> My favorite part of Snapchat&mdash;it&rsquo;s less numbers-focused. </strong>I don&rsquo;t know how many people are following me. I can see how many views my story gets every day, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel like a popularity contest, which is totally refreshing.</li><br />
</ol></p>
<ol start="10">
<li><strong> Tell the world you&rsquo;re snapping! </strong>It&rsquo;s difficult to discover new people to follow within Snapchat&mdash;they need your username or snapcode. Take a screenshot of your snapcode and share on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Put your username in your email footer. Upload your snap code to your about page. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ASK! Many people are just starting to use Snapchat and are looking for interesting, engaging folks to follow.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Learning a new social media tool can be overwhelming, but don&rsquo;t let it stop you. You can do it! If Snapchat has still got your noggin&rsquo; totally bogglin&rsquo;, just spend 5 minutes a day playing in the app and watch these beginner tutorials:</p>
