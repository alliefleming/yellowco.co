<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-182.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7300" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-182.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-18" width="700" height="467" /></a><strong>I learned about this term &ldquo;soul places&rdquo; from a little boutique owner in Laguna Beach, and have now used it to describe the paces where I come most alive and feel most grounded - my favorite feeling. </strong></span></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I love the feeling of being led by my inner truth, and feeling like I am connected to a deeper source of life. When things become crazy and unbalanced and I need some grounding, it&rsquo;s not always evident until these warning signs pop up: I&rsquo;m extra critical of others, I&rsquo;m overly sensitive and emotional to things I&rsquo;m normally easy going about, I start to cancel or dread important meetings, and I start telling my friends I&rsquo;m &ldquo;going rogue," which involves moving to Costa Rica to bartend and live off of coconut milk and papaya. These are my personal warning signs, but everyone&rsquo;s are different. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often with running a business you run on empty and find yourself caught up in too many meetings, running creatively dry, and generally just becoming a bit unpleasant by the end of the day. When I start to hit that spot, it&rsquo;s time to try and get somewhere I can S-L-O-W down.&nbsp;For me there are a few escapes that help me get back to grounded. I go where I can either in the moment, or I try to plan something when I can anticipate a busy time coming to an end.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-162.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7298" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-162.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-16" width="700" height="467" /></a></span><em><strong>For instant gratification: I go somewhere I can be alone in nature. </strong></em></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Truth be told I&rsquo;m not a beach person, BUT I live near the beach, so I use this place as an escape when I need to pull an emergency rip cord. I go ALL THE WAY to the end of the peninsula where there are virtually zero people, and sit. Sometimes I meditate, sometimes I listen to music, sometimes I journal, pray, or just walk around and hunt for sea glass. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key for me is to reconnect to how vast and big this gorgeous earth is &ndash; which usually helps me see my troubles or anxiety for what they are&nbsp;&ndash; small.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-173.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7299" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-173.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-17" width="700" height="467" /></a></span><em><strong>For a quick trip: I go somewhere removed from my immediate environment that I don&rsquo;t know well. </strong></em></h4><br />
If I can clear a day or a half day off my schedule to go somewhere new, this helps me get grounded by forcing me out of my comfort zone. I then have to rely on my immediate desires and instincts to guide me. I love his because it feels so indulgent! I let myself have a chocolate croissant at a little roadside caf&eacute;, or pack a quick picnic from a gas station deli and sit in a field off some random hiking path. This may sound bizarre, which is the point. Go be random &ndash; research &ldquo;cute towns near me&rdquo; or &ldquo;free hiking near me&rdquo; and see where it takes you. Follow your own path and don&rsquo;t be afraid to look weird &ndash; no one knows you where you are which is half the fun &ndash; no expectations to meet.</p>
<h4><em><strong>For a planned trip: I go somewhere that reminds me of my favorite place in nature: home.</strong></em></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was blessed to grow up in a rural forested area. I LOVE being in the trees, and somewhere with seasons and fresh smells. If you can clearly see the night sky with no light pollution, count me IN. When I am coming off a busy season and know I&rsquo;m facing burnout, I head for home or somewhere that reminds me of home. Being in Southern CA, few places meet those requirements. The closest I have found is Lake Arrowhead. But exploring other, more rural nearby counties and states has filled me up, when a big vacation is not in the cards. &nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><em><strong>So, once I&rsquo;m out in nature doing my Zen thang...then what?</strong></em></h4></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, I wear clothes that make me feel most </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">me</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You know those outfits that are so on point, yet a bit quirky? Yep, those. For me, cowboy boots come into the mix, since I rarely get to wear them. They&rsquo;re my soul shoe. &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always bring a notebook and write A LOT. My feelings are typically most fresh and true in a new environment away from my demands. I get tons of new ideas, and resolve old ones. I make copious amounts of lists as well, so that I can capture the to do&rsquo;s I will re-address at home. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I listen to a lot of acoustic music. It helps me slow down, and feel taken care of. For me, positivity and love is what I want to surround me when I feel weak. For others, maybe hip hop or loud pop just takes them to a place that feels powerful &ndash; whatever floats your inner boat y&rsquo;all. </span></li><br />
</ul><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you ever feel the craziness of the world coming in on you, and like you want to run away &ndash; I say<em> go</em>. No, don&rsquo;t move to Austin because you hear it&rsquo;s so now and weird (that&rsquo;s called running from your problems, and from personal experience, I don&rsquo;t recommend that), just take a quick trip to a place where no one knows you, and you can be free to table your worries for just a day.</span></p>
