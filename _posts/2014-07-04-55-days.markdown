<p>Hey ladies! Can you believe that in just 55 days we are going to be hanging out together at The Yellow Conference?? If you haven't <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/the-yellow-conference" target="_blank">bought your ticket yet</a>, be sure to do so sooner than later. We are busy getting details squared away and can't wait to share them all with you in August!</p>
<p>If you're new around here, The Yellow Conference is a gathering for creative women who desire to ignite passion and bring goodness to the world through everyday living. We have some amazing speakers coming this year. Women like Sarah Dubbledam, the founder of <a href="http://darlingmagazine.org/" target="_blank">Darling Magazine</a>, Promise Tangeman, founder of <a href="http://sitehousedesigns.com/" target="_blank">Sitehouse Designs</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/AjaLBrown" target="_blank">Mayor Aja Brown</a>, who is currently rocking it while serving as the Mayor of Compton. We also have some cool guys joining us. We have Dale Partridge, the founder of <a href="http://www.sevenly.org/" target="_blank">Sevenly</a> and <a href="http://dalepartridge.com/" target="_blank">TheDailyPositive.com</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/loswhit" target="_blank">Carlos Whittaker</a>, who just finished writing a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moment-Maker-Live-Your-Life/dp/0310337976" target="_blank">Moment Maker</a> (so good!) and blogs over at <a href="http://ragamuffinsoul.com/" target="_blank">RagamuffinSoul.com</a>.</p>
<p>Ladies, this is going to be a weekend you will remember for years to come. A mix of inspiration and practical advice for living out your dreams and spreading good throughout the world. We guarantee you won't leave just feeling inspired, then not know where to go. Our goal is to have you leaving the conference feeling empowered, knowing what practical steps, no matter how big or how small, you can take as soon as the day after the conference.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/the-yellow-conference" target="_blank">join us ladies</a>! We have a limited number of spots and we are selling quickly.</p>
<p>Can't wait to hang with you all in August!</p>
