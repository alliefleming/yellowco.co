[![Creative Women Can Change the World](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creative-Women-Can-Change-the-World1.jpg)](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Creative-Women-Can-Change-the-World1.jpg)

Attention lady world changers! The Yellow Conference is more than a conference. We have a strong desire to create a community. We are like minded women with different skills, talents and gifts. We want to support, encourage, and know each other.

No one change the world alone, so we decided to create a resource list for people and/or businesses to refer to when looking for specific talent or skills. We are world changers who have the desire to spread good and want to work with like minded ladies! We would LOVE to add you to the list.

Here's what you do: Leave a comment at the bottom of this post with your **name**, **skill/profession**, **website link** and any **social media** you'd like to include. Here's an example:

We will compile the comments into a list that will soon be added as a "Resource Page" on our website.Â Can't wait to meet you all and see all the amazing skills you have!

Have a wonderful weekend lady world-changers.
