I felt stuck.

I was going through the motions. Project after project, not really seeing any larger purpose in my work or having an end goal.

I wanted to do something that matters, something that had purpose. And I struggled because I felt as if I couldn't find any meaning in my daily work as a graphic designer.

This was one of the reasons I wanted to start The Yellow Conference. I wanted to hear from women who living passionate lives. Women who were kicking booty and doing it for a larger purpose. Doing more than just going through the motions. Doing more than living for fame or money.

**This is what this quarter's theme is all about: using our gifts, skills and passions for something that's bigger than just you and me.**

Using what we have to make the world a better place. To create change, to fight to further good in this world, to fight against the evil things that are happening on a daily basis.

I'm personally very excited to bring you articles under this theme, and I'm really excited to start it off with our Bloom Gathering that carries the same theme.

**Whether you're an activist, entrepreneur or are curious about ways to use what you have to serve a greater purpose, this gathering is for you.**

We will hear from teen foster care advocate and founder of the [TEEN LEADERSHIP FOUNDATION](teenleadershipfoundation.com), Lisa Castetter, as she tells us her story and advice on running a for-good business. This woman is full of knowledge and wisdom, and I personally am so excited to hear from her.

We will be gathering at our good friend's [Share & Do Good](http://www.shareanddogood.com/) at Downtown Fullerton. Tickets are $18 which includes food, time with Lisa, and a few goodies from us :)
