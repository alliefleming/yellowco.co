<p>I felt stuck.</p>
<p>I was going through the motions. Project after project, not really seeing any larger purpose in my work or having an end goal.</p>
<p>I wanted to do something that matters, something that had purpose. And I struggled because I felt as if I couldn't find any meaning in my daily work as a graphic designer.</p>
<p>This was one of the reasons I wanted to start The Yellow Conference. I wanted to hear from women who living passionate lives. Women who were kicking booty and doing it for a larger purpose. Doing more than just going through the motions. Doing more than living for fame or money.</p>
<p><strong>This is what this quarter's theme is all about: using our gifts, skills and passions for something that's bigger than just you and me.</strong></p>
<p>Using what we have to make the world a better place. To create change, to fight to further good in this world, to fight against the evil things that are happening on a daily basis.</p>
<p>I'm personally very excited to bring you articles under this theme, and I'm really excited to start it off with our Bloom Gathering&nbsp;that carries the same theme.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/July_BLOOMGATHERING.jpg"><img class=" size-full wp-image-3228 alignleft" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/July_BLOOMGATHERING.jpg" alt="July_BLOOMGATHERING" width="700" height="638" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Whether you're an activist, entrepreneur or are curious&nbsp;about ways to use what you have to serve a greater purpose, this gathering is for you.</strong></p>
<p>We will hear from teen foster care advocate and founder of the <a href="teenleadershipfoundation.com" target="_blank">TEEN LEADERSHIP FOUNDATION</a>, Lisa Castetter, as she tells us her story and advice on running a for-good business. This woman is full of knowledge and wisdom, and&nbsp;I personally am so excited to hear from her.</p>
<p>We will be gathering at our good friend's <a href="http://www.shareanddogood.com/" target="_blank">Share &amp; Do Good</a> at Downtown Fullerton. Tickets are $18 which&nbsp;includes food, time with Lisa, and a few goodies from us :)</p>
