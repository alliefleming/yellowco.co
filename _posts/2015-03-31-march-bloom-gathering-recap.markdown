It was a bright and beautiful Sunday afternoon, and&nbsp;our lovely brunch gathering started off with a bit of a hiccup when we found out that the studio wasn&rsquo;t going to be open until 11:30 for our planned 10:30am event...That however, did not stop all the attending ladies from engaging in conversation with one another at <a href="https://instagram.com/theclassiccoffee" target="_blank">the Classic Coffee</a> (walking distance away from the loft). It is in moments like these- the &ldquo;interrupted&rdquo; and &ldquo;unplanned&rdquo; that truly remind us how life is meant to be lived, not always planned out, yet seeping with intentionality. This mishap led into genuine conversation later on where authenticity and community were just a few of the buzzwords circulating the coffee shop. When we were finally able to enter the loft, the beautiful all white, studio became even brighter while women continued to engage&nbsp;in table discussion, laugh, and munch on fruit, cinnamon rolls and sipping on mimosas.</p>

<p>When it came to closing our morning together, we gathered in a circle and talked about the questions as a group:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean to be &lsquo;living in community&rsquo; as a woman in today&rsquo;s world?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&ldquo;Is the ability to connect digitally stopping us from knowing how to connect in person?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&ldquo;What do you see as the main differences between online and in person community?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you remain authentic in your social and online lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the main thing stopping you from participating in and offering what you can to that community?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-image-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2476" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-image-3.jpg" alt="blog image 3" width="700" height="1050" /></a><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-image-4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2477" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/blog-image-4.jpg" alt="blog image 4" width="700" height="1050" /></a>&nbsp;Throughout the conversation we found that our answer for navigating through these questions is coming to terms with who we are and how to orchestrate that knowledge in a transparent way through all that we do. Facilitating the group discussion was the Yellow Co.'s&nbsp;founder Joanna. Her closing remark was, <em>&ldquo;We have to be okay with our flawed selves, we also have to be okay with others flawed selves and have grace with each other.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>The heart of&nbsp;Yellow, in addition to bringing creative women together, is to create a non-competitive, positive, space for women to engage with one another and truly be their whole self. Remember, that you have so much to give to the communities you find yourselves in and remaining your true self within them is more than enough.</p>

<p>In the end, (even with the hiccup) it was a beautiful morning, inspiring&nbsp;every woman to leave bubbly and filled with good insight and exchanges with one another.</p>
