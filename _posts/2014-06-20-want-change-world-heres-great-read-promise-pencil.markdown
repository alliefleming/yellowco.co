I'm not a huge reader, but it's something I've tried to get myself to do more in recent times. I
have a collection of unfinished books. Books I've started reading but never finished. If I want to
finish what I've started, I really have to discipline myself, as it's definitely not something that
comes naturally to me.\

I recently finished reading
[_The Promise of a Pencil_](http://www.amazon.com/Promise-Pencil-Ordinary-Person-Extraordinary/dp/1476730628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403278338&sr=1-1&keywords=promise+of+a+pencil)
by Adam Braun, and I'm not sure if it was because I was traveling a lot and had some good plane time
to read this thing, or if it was really that intriguing to me, (I think it was a mix of both) but I
finished this book in record time! (for me anyway!)

\_[The Promise of a Pencil](http://www.amazon.com/Promise-Pencil-Ordinary-Person-Extraordinary/dp/1476730628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403278338&sr=1-1&keywords=promise+of+a+pencil)
_is about a young guy named Adam, who started a nonprofit at the age of 24 years old, with $25\.
While traveling as a college student, Adam met a young boy on the streets of India. He asked this
boy what he wanted most in the world. He answered, "a pencil." This became the inspiration for his
company, [Pencils of Promise](http://pencilsofpromise.org/). When he started, he had one goal- to
build a school in a country filled with poverty. Over the next 6 years, his organization grew into
something much bigger. Today, [Pencils of Promise](http://pencilsofpromise.org/) has built over 200
schools all over the world, has served almost 30,000 students, and has delivered over 15 M hours of
education. This book is all about Braun's journey to getting his organization to the where it is
today.

Each chapter starts with a mantra such as, "_Vulnerability is vital" _and is followed by the chapter
that goes into explaining a story about how, where and when he learned this lesson, as well as why
it's important. He goes into the ups and downs he experienced while growing his nonprofit, including
why he no longer refers to his organization as a nonprofit, but rather, a "for purpose" company.

The way Adam writes makes you feel as if you are there with him - he is both a great motivator and
storyteller. This book is full of great advice for starting not just an organization, but a
movement. It's inspiring, entertaining, and gives practical tips anyone can use to change the world
for good.

I loved how this book gives great advice that really anyone can use in any business, but it's all
for the greater good. It has a purpose bigger than itself, more than just money. He puts a
purposeful spin on everything, letting us know that we were made for something bigger. That with the
right drive and the right purpose, we all can change the world with something that starts as a
dream. For anyone who is looking to start an organization or wants to work for one- this is a
[must read!](http://www.amazon.com/Promise-Pencil-Ordinary-Person-Extraordinary/dp/1476730628/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1403278338&sr=1-1&keywords=promise+of+a+pencil)

I mean, Sir Richard Branson said it himself, "For anyone with a big dream to transform the world,
this book will show you how to get it done." So you know it's good. ;)
