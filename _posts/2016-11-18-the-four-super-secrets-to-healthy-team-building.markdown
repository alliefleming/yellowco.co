<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>We were created to live and breathe community.</strong> To be around others, learn from others, grow from others, and also be teachable to others. Communities can vary in different types of settings: from church groups, to exercise buddies, philanthropy friends, and so on. Not only is building a healthy community in our personal lives important &ndash; it is just as vital to know how to build a healthy team in your organization or business. When we begin to place an importance on building this nature of a team, we are providing ourselves the space to grow and lead successfully.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-59.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-7283" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-59-683x1024.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-59" width="683" height="1024" /></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first and very most important part of building a healthy and successful team is incorporating self-care. Eryn Eddy once said,</span><b><i> "If you work harder on your job than yourself, you will lose yourself."</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Self-care is provided for you, by you. It is about identifying your own needs and taking steps to meet them, taking the time to do some of the activities that nurture you, and taking proper care of yourself and treating yourself as kindly as you would treat others. </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make it first nature</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - it most likely isn't first nature for you. Self-care should be a priority as a leader so that you are able to set in place and demonstrate this important foundational care to your team.<br />
</span></span></li></p>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Arrange consistent check-ins with your team -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How are each of them individually? Take the time to not only check in on the team as a whole in group meetings, but set aside time to check in with them personally.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Encourage individuals to follow their bodies warning signs -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Sleep deprived, depressed feelings, ill, hungry?</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Make time for YOU -</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> talk openly with a trusted friend, go for a run/walk, journal, do some breathing exercises. Support this type of living to your team as well. We&nbsp;must be able to learn and strengthen ourselves before we&nbsp;can teach and strengthen another. </span></li><br />
</ol><br />
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-care is provided for you, by you.</strong></span></i></p>
<h2><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-62.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7285" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ValerieDenisePhotos-62.jpg" alt="valeriedenisephotos-62" width="700" height="467" /></a></span></i><strong>Once self-care is engaged, the team can begin to focus on the vision of the organization. </strong></h2><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">What morals and values should be set? Placing a running whiteboard in the hallway for your team to write and reevaluate the vision is an excellent resource for those quick and important thoughts that run through the mind. Make room for questions and ANY type of question (remember, there is never a bad one). Create occasions for team outings like bowling, group runs, sport competitions, potlucks, etc. Brainstorm and establish team and individual goals where they are written out, given a timeline, assigned responsibilities, and where creativity and new ideas are welcome. Assigning accountability partners is a great tool to use once these goals are established! Individuals are able to set aside time to meet weekly and make sure that they are doing their part in the growing process of the organization. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building a healthy team will not only help you, but it will also build your organization and give each of you the ability to follow through with the vision set before you. The same way of building a strong community in your personal life to help you achieve those specific desires outside of work, building a strong team in the workplace will also assist in empowerment and have a greater potential to successfully make an impact and fill those needs as an organization. &nbsp;</span></p>
