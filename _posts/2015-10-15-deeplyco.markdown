<h5><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I am after celebrating the art of a beautiful life &ndash; one evening, one human at a time.</span></h5></p>
<h6><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_4157-formatted.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4119" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_4157-formatted.jpg" alt="Jillian Edwards for Yellow Conference" width="700" height="467" /></a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">One of the dearest truths ever taught to me is this: </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">every person has their own magic.</em></h6><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Throughout my childhood and even now, it is instilled in me that recognizing and valuing the gifts in those around you is one of the surest ways to extend love. This belief is not only an anchor for my pursuit as an artist, but it has also become the heartbeat of&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.thedeeplyco.com/" target="_blank">The Deeply Co</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;- a creative collaboration entity that exists to celebrate makers of all kinds.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My name is&nbsp;</span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.jillianedwards.com/" target="_blank">Jillian Edwards</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, and I am a singer-songwriter out of Nashville, TN who stumbled into launching The Deeply Co this past year in effort to stay inspired, and to celebrate beauty.&nbsp;I am after celebrating the art of a beautiful life &ndash; one evening, one human at a time.</span></p>
<p>Through the work of Deeply, I have the delight of hosting evenings of community, art, and music across the country &ndash; in unconventional spaces, transformed into intimate music venues and art showcases for one night only. We fill these little spaces with 50-70 ticketed guests, local beverage and food vendors, a dainty sound system for a short and sweet musical set by yours truly, and a display of art by Deeply&rsquo;s featured creative in each city.</p>

<p>Although Deeply began as a concert series, we are expanding to launch online events as well - starting with our first ever Deeply Market this November. We will be spotlighting exclusive items from some of our favorite makers we&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of working with, and a few fresh faces to our circle as well! We have lofty dreams for the future of Deeply, but for now we are taking baby steps - cultivating evenings of warmth and refreshment to applaud people who pour themselves into bringing good things to the world.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/469B4275-formatted.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4117" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/469B4275-formatted.jpg" alt="Jillian Edwards for Yellow Conference" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p>To invite you into the unfolding of Deeply, I feel pressed to acknowledge that it grew out of a season of slowness. I felt a compelling need to be reenergized, refreshed, and renewed within my artistry. I was longing for movement when life had me standing still. Little did I know, it was this very moment that would provide opportunity for new vision.&nbsp; I began to imagine, realistically, how to build my dream concert scenario. My heart and mind started racing as I began to imagine hosting gatherings celebrating all types of art, cultivating a space for community and encouragement.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/469B4261-formatted.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4116" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/469B4261-formatted.jpg" alt="Jillian Edwards for Yellow Conference" width="700" height="466" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">There are so many people in my life who are bravely pursuing their own forms of artistry, and the thought of all of us doing what makes us come alive spun me into a huge brainstorming session&hellip;that still hasn't ended. I started to make a list of friends, acquaintances, and people I had never met who inspire me with their lives. Every time I came across a beautiful space, I added it to the list. Every time a maker caught my attention, whether it was a calligrapher or a boutique owner, a leather-goods crafter, or anything else, I jotted their name down. After sending out several, I mean&nbsp;</span><em style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">several,&nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">out of the blue e-mails... I started hearing back from people!</span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Through the work of The Deeply Co, it has been made clear to me that there is great value in taking steps forward in pursuit of what makes you come alive, as well as an immeasurable worth in seeking out the magic in others.</span></em></blockquote><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I could hardly believe people I had never met were interested, even excited to help me host a Deeply evening in their city and creative space - all for the sake of celebrating the things that are dear to us.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Since our official launch in May of this year, we have had the joy of hosting 11 events across the country and are premiering an online makers-focused event this fall. Through the work of The Deeply Co, it has been made clear to me that there is great value in taking steps forward in pursuit of what makes you come alive, as well as an immeasurable worth in seeking out the magic in others. While Deeply creates events to spotlight tangible works of art, it is the greater calling of our company to open our eyes to the beauty in every moment by extending love to others - for that is the purist form of art. Perhaps Van Gogh said it best: </span>"There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> So I will try, and try deeply.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Interested in being involved with The Deeply Co? I'd love to hear from you and dream together about what an evening could look like in your city!
