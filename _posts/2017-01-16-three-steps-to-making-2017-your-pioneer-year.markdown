No one has embarked on 2017 before now. The future is uncertain but we aim to press deeper than the year before, crafting resolutions and goals to guide us there.  </p>
<p>There is something refreshing about a new start. A new year. The change of one day can turn well worn rhythms into a fresh cadence. The way we step into 2017 can guide the nature of the months that follow.</p>
<p>Each year, a few of my girlfriends and I gather together to reflect on the previous year and seek vision for&nbsp;the next. Without fail, this day becomes significant in establishing the foundation from which I build my dreams and actions for the year. The words we share and speak over each other become my anthem when I need to be brave and my refrain when I am feeling discouraged.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can reflect and dream for this year:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Take time to reflect.</b></em>  We can&rsquo;t truly look ahead without acknowledging the journey we've been on. Gather 2 or 3 friends and spend some time reflecting on the sweet and the bitter from 2016. Give each person 10 minutes to share, uninterrupted <em>(This is important as sometimes our good intentioned thoughts can stunt our friend&rsquo;s thought process).</em> Then for the next 10 minutes, take turns speaking affirming truth to&nbsp;that friend. What truth did you hear in her words?&nbsp;What strengths did you recognize?&nbsp; </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Choose a word over your year.</b></em>  Each year I select a word as a banner of what I want to live and act under. Every year, that word becomes richer and deeper than I could have ever anticipated. Some people like to make a visual craft with the word displayed in their home as a reminder of what they are striving for. I do not have much patience when it comes to scissors and paper so I choose to have my word inscribed on a necklace each year through <a href="https://www.thegivingkeys.com/" target="_blank">The Giving Keys</a>. It hangs around my neck all year as a reminder of what the year will bring.  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><b>Give words to each other. </b></em> We all know words are powerful, but sometimes it can feel intimidating trying to come up with the right thing to share with a friend. I&rsquo;ve found there are words that lie in the deep but all it takes is a little thinking outside of the box to get them out. Gather your friends, turn on some reflective music, grab a bunch of blank scratch paper and pens, and spend 20 minutes writing down words, any words, phrases, or symbols that come to mind. Write them down individually on a single piece of paper. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of writing down even weird objects that come to mind! I kept thinking about popcorn during my time and when I wrote it down, I started to reflect on what happens to popcorn. It starts as a kernel and then when pressured with heat it bursts into wholeness. This ended up being a profound word for one of my friends. When everyone is done, pile up all the papers and sit in a circle. Go around the table, one by one, and pick up the paper on top of the pile and read it aloud. These words are yours to take a reflect on for the new year.  </li><br />
</ol><br />
 Taking time to <strong>pause</strong> and<strong> prepare</strong> for the year is one way we can step forward and embrace the unknown with anticipation. Giving one day, or a few hours, can alter the depth in which you enter into the twelve month path laid before you. So travel onward, my friends, with strength in your step and a vision in your heart. 2017 is bound to be the best year yet. </p>
