The holidays are almost here and that typically means: holiday shopping! With so many amazing social good brands on the market, the holidays are a great opportunity to purchase with purpose and buy gifts that give back! Running a social good brand myself, I am always keeping up with the best ethical fashion, clean beauty, and fair trade products, so I made this list of some of my favorites for you to choose from this holiday season! Each brand gives back to the world either literally through their business model, or through their ethical, sustainable, or fair-trade practices. ***Plus, grab discounts from all of these brands below!***

#### **1. [The Dressy Sweatpant](https://www.encircled.co/collections/our-designs/products/the-dressy-sweatpant) by [Encircled](https://www.encircled.co/)**

Encircled's dressy sweatpants are the most versatile and comfortable pants I've seen! They can be dressed up or down depending on your mood, and they are a perfect addition to any capsule wardrobe — for winter or summer! I love Encircled as a company so much because of their commitment to sustainability and ethical practices.

#### 2. **[Espe Booties](http://www.therootcollective.com/shop-womens/espe-in-midnight-preorder/) by [The Root Collective](http://www.therootcollective.com/)**

These Espe booties are handcrafted in Guatemala by skilled artisans. They are made from the most beautiful genuine leather and have a handwoven cotton fabric accent, which make them so unique. The best thing about them is you know you are helping empower artisans by buying them!

#### **3. [Bamboo Capsule Palette](https://elatebeauty.com/collections/tools/products/bamboo-capsule-palette) by [Elate Cosmetics](https://elatebeauty.com/)**

I recently made a switch to all-natural, clean beauty products. Elate Cosmetics is a brand that prides themselves on just this: clean beauty. They are vegan, toxic-free, and cruelty free! They use all healthy ingredients and value sustainable practices in their production. They sell the bamboo palettes separate from the eyeshadow colors, pressed powders, and blushes so that you can just refill those and decrease waste.

#### **4. [Chocolate Bar Gift Set](https://madecasse.com/product/4-bar-gift-set/) by [Madécasse](https://madecasse.com/)**

Started by another Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (holla!), I love this company already. Their chocolate is made from heirloom cocoa, a more flavorful variety, and they buy directly from the cocoa farmers in Madagascar, empowering the local community and spurring commerce. Not only do I LOVE chocolate, but I love the mission behind this company, too. They have lots of cute gift sets including a dark chocolate set with a mix of pure 70%, sea salt and nibs, toasted coconut, and salted almonds.

**Use code yellowco for 15% off of orders over $50 until December 31st, 2017.**

#### **5. [Half Moon Crossbody Clutch](https://ssekodesigns.com/leather-bags/crossbody-bags/half-moon-crossbody-clutch-oiled-black.html?acc=b922ede9c9eb9eabec1c1fecbdecb45d) by [Sseko](https://ssekodesigns.com/)**

Over the summer I visited Sseko's workshop in Uganda and I was blown away! The Sseko artisans are such an inspiring group of women! Sseko makes beautiful sandals, clothing, bags, and jewelry. The Half Moon Crossbody Clutch in black would be a perfect Christmas gift for someone else or for yourself. It's made of the softest leather, and you'll know you're helping empower women in East Africa when you or your loved one wears it!

**Use code YELLOWCHRISTMAS for 10% off until December 31st, 2017.**

#### **6. [Samana Sunstone Shimmer](https://wabisabibotanicals.com/products/samana-sunstone-shimmer-elixir) by [Wabi Sabi Botanicals](https://wabisabibotanicals.com/)**

This is an all-natural skincare line that empowers women around the world. All products are naturally made with no harsh chemicals, synthetic preservatives, fragrances, or colorants, and they source organic, wild harvested and sustainable ingredients whenever possible. All products are cruelty free, and to top it off, they're packaged in reusable glass bottles! Try their Samana Sunstone Shimmer Elixir — it's a bestseller!

#### **7. [Spiral Notebook in Steel Blue](http://www.mariemae.com/shop/the-good-office-collection-spiral-notebook-steel-blue) by [Marie Mae Company](http://www.mariemae.com/)**

Marie Mae Company's motto is “write with purpose” and they have the most darling notebooks with this written on the front! They are beautiful and what's even more great is that Marie Mae Company's founder provides an hour of business training to women in emerging market economies for every product sold! In addition to their notebooks, they also have pretty stationary and other office products that give back!

#### 8.  **[“Seattle” Blanket](https://www.wakenedapparel.org/collections/blankets/products/the-seattle-blanket) by [Wakened Apparel](https://www.wakenedapparel.org/)**

This apparel and lifestyle company gives back 10% of each sale to carefully vetted charities! All of their products are either ethically-made in the US or if made abroad, they are all Fair Trade. My favorite product is their line of zero-waste blankets from Mexico. These blankets come in the coolest prints and colors, and are made from recycled apparel remnants! Wakened Apparel's founder is also an awesome sustainable and conscious living blogger, and she really knows how to choose ethically-made products!

**Use code Yellow10 for 10% off.**

#### **9. [Miramar Leather Backpack](https://www.parkerclay.com/collections/womens/products/miramar-leather-backpack?variant=34762912774) by [Parker Clay](https://www.parkerclay.com/)**

This brand is incredible! They make lifestyle goods that are ethically handcrafted by women in Ethiopia. They also partner with a non-profit in Ethiopia and help vulnerable women stay out of the sex industry by assisting them with skills training, counseling, and rehabilitation. Parker Clay's products are beautiful! My current favorite is their Miramar Leather Backpack! It comes in black or rust brown, and has adjustable straps. It's a perfect gift for your travel-loving best friend (or yourself!).

**Use code YELLOW15 for 15% off.**

#### **10. [The Minimal Capsule](https://www.vettacapsule.com/collections/the-minimal-capsule) by [Vetta](https://www.vettacapsule.com/)**

This brand is all about the capsule wardrobe. They have a few different collections each year with 5 different pieces of clothing that can be worn 30 different ways — that means you can buy 5 pieces and be set for a whole month. This is a traveler's dream (me!). Most of their fabric comes from deadstock (leftovers) or is sustainably made and biodegradable. Plus, they only work with responsible factories that are audited for social and environmental compliance. Pretty incredible! Their latest capsule is called the Minimal Capsule!

**Use code YellowCo for 10% off.**

#### **11. [Leather-strapped Tote Bag](https://www.kurandza.org/bags/1p2zyg47k4i54sc8w25p9vgewg1855) by [Kurandza](https://www.kurandza.org/)**

So I may be a little biased on this one, but one of my favorite bags are Kurandza's leather-strapped batik totes. These bags are handcrafted using African wax-print cotton fabric that's sourced in northern Mozambique. The women of Kurandza's sewing cooperative make these tote bags, which help them earn a sustainable income and send their children to school. I love these bags— I use mine all the time as a yoga bag, to carry my computer and notebooks around when I work at a café, or even as a shopping bag!

#### **12. [Traditional Fedora](https://equaluprise.com/products/traditional-fedora-light-grey?variant=28867395537) by [Equal Uprise](https://equaluprise.com/)**

These are pretty much my most favorite hats! I love all the colors and styles, but I'd have to say that my current favorite for winter is the Traditional Fedora. The light grey one is perfect! Again, if I could get one in each color, I would! They are so stylish, and for those of you who love capsule wardrobes, you know that an accessory, like a nice hat, helps to diversify the look! Artisans in Ecuador make the hats, and each sale helps them earn a steady income. A percentage of each sale goes back into their business development program, too!
