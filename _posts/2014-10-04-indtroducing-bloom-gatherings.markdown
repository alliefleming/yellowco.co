Not sure about you, but after Yellow Conference ended, I was craving more time with the dreamers, the creatives, the ones who want to change the world. Because of this, the decision was make to create smaller gatherings where us like-minded ladies can get together, have some time to hang out on a smaller level, and work together on a creative do-good project. Hello Bloom Gatherings!

Our first Bloom Gathering will be taking place in **LA on Oct. 13th, 7:30pm**. (To those not local to the area - working on a way we can do these across the country, just not quite there yet! Hang tight!!) We are partnering with [Homestead](http://www.homesteadca.com/about.html)- which is a nightly rental company with an amazing network of styled houses for shoots, getaways and events in LA. They are awesome for locals and travelers alike, and their Echo Park location is where we will be hanging that night.

We are going to be getting together and decorating yellow balloons with encouraging notes, sayings and thoughts (all while sipping on some bubbly and nibbling on desserts, of course.) Once we are done, we will be heading outside to disperse the balloons throughout the city. Our hope is when the sun rises in the morning, unsuspecting people of all ages will stumble upon these bright balloons and be encouraged by the sayings on them.

So LA, come join us to bring some good to this city and make new friends. You can find more info on our event page [here](http://yellowconference.com/bloomgathering). [Tickets are $39](https://ti.to/yellowconference/bloom-gathering-drinks-doodles), which includes a small bag of goodies, dessert, drinks and a network of like-minded women. You can [get yours here](https://ti.to/yellowconference/bloom-gathering-drinks-doodles). We are almost sold out, so it's recommended to get your ticket sooner than later!

Hope to see you there ladies. And for those of you not able to make it, you can follow along on our event hashtag #bloomgathering and of course #bloomyellow. Have a wonderful weekend!
