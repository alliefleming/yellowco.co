I can't think of a better time to launch this series: the pumpkin spice lattes are out, cozy sweaters are being hung, and there's a sense of new as the leaves and trees are being painted with Autumn's colors.

It is Fall, my friends!

And there's something so sweet, so fresh and new about this season--the wind chimes blow welcoming in new, crisp, refreshing air. We warm our hands with full cups, and there's a sense of _gathering_ and _slowness _that's unique to this season. I love it.

###### Our next series is all about this: the brilliant air of new; the restorative feeling of letting what's past fall, and anticipating what's new to bloom.

By definition, to be refined is to make oneself more polished, cultivated, elegant, subtle, precise.

In other words:

###### To be refined is to know why you are doing what you are doing, and to do it as well as you possibly can.

I think that the terms elegance and subtle have been far lost and misconstrued as adjectives only applicable to an Audrey Hepburn movie. Being elegant is a lost art that we want to dive into and redefine and repurpose into our dreams, our personal lives, our businesses, and our crafts.

> This is a series on how to become more of yourself in order to change the world, build your brand, grow your character, and cultivate the legacy you want leave behind.

We want to grow more as leaders, professionals, a wife, a mom, a sister, teacher, painter...whoever you are-to take what you have and fine tune to become more of what you've always dreamed of.

This is what being refined is all about. 

###### This is not a series about shutting yourself down to grow more famous on social media or get rich quick.

This is a series on how to become more of yourself in order to change the world, build your brand, grow your character, and cultivate the legacy you want leave behind.

The posts featured will be tangible, full of evidence that we can enrich ourselves personally and professionally to signify our mark on the world.

We at Yellow Co. are driven by the desire to empower, build, harvest, and glean our brand, organization, and self into something useful for the greater good.

Growth, refreshment, nourishment, refinement...cultivate. Whether in business or personal life, we all need this, and we are excited to journey along with you.

Always be blooming,

Sally+The Yellow Co. Team
