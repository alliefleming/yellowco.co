<p>Introverts, Let&rsquo;s Get Real...</p>
<p>We live in a culture where celebrity reigns, big personalities are praised, and all of society is urging us to do more, be more, go go go! We have a deep-seeded extrovert ideal in our world today, whether we realize it or not.</p>
<p>Susan Cain, in her book,&nbsp;<em>Quiet</em>, defines&nbsp;the &ldquo;Extrovert Ideal&rdquo; is <em>&ldquo;the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight,&rdquo; </em>preferring<em> &ldquo;action to contemplation, risk-taking to heed-taking, certainty to doubt.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Yeah, that&rsquo;s not me at all. Hardcore introvert over here!</p>
<p>Introverts like me can feel so much pressure to act like extroverts:&nbsp;be outgoing, be loud, be on <em>all the time</em> and perform&hellip;but that&rsquo;s not our nature.</p>
<p>How can we, the ones who might rather hang back and observe, listen, be quiet, and spend time alone, live and thrive in a world that holds extroverts in such high regard? How can we be truly ourselves without feeling like we have to play charades or put on a fa&ccedil;ade just to keep up with everyone else?</p>
<p>Hint: it&rsquo;s not by acting like somebody (or some type) that we aren&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s not by hiding who we are. It&rsquo;s about being real with ourselves and those around us.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I (introverted through and through) have found to be helpful:</p>
<p><strong>I let people know I&rsquo;m an introvert. Straight up.</strong>&nbsp;Let's silence the stigmas&mdash;we aren&rsquo;t loners or recluses or social outcasts. We just interact differently with the world and the people in it. I bring up my Myers Briggs in conversations as a way of helping to explain why or how I feel a certain way about things (I&rsquo;m an INFJ&mdash;anyone else?!). I say the word &ldquo;introvert&rdquo; freely, not hesitantly or cautiously. I am an introvert, and I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
<p><strong>I make adjustments to social settings and scenarios.</strong> I know that if I walk in to a full room or a crowded party or a full sanctuary, I&rsquo;ll be overwhelmed, so I arrive early. I know I hate feeling trapped or stuck, so I make sure I sit on the aisle. I know I don&rsquo;t like being in the spotlight, so I volunteer for behind-the-scenes roles instead. I don&rsquo;t make a big deal out of it all, but I don&rsquo;t apologize for it either. I&rsquo;ll be happier and feel more comfortable if certain things happen, so I make the necessary adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>I spend time in solitude.</strong> I know my heart and soul need this. I also know my creativity needs this. I need to recharge. I need to disconnect from people and pressures and technology. I need to put my pen to paper instead of typing all the time, need to read ink on paper instead of staring at a screen, need to breathe fresh air, seek adventure, connect with nature. I find time to get away from all the noise, the people, the to-do lists, knowing that when I return, I&rsquo;ll be more present and engaged and ready for action.</p>
<blockquote><p>I could tell people when I needed a break or just needed some silence, and they would learn to understand. Trying to hide it or fake it or lie about it was helping no one&mdash;my being real and honest and transparent, in contrast, helped everyone.</blockquote><br />
<strong>I&rsquo;m real with the people around me.</strong> Authenticity and vulnerability are absolutely essential in forming and building strong relationships. For so long, I tried to keep up with my more extroverted friends, tagging along to all of their parties and staying up late with a room full of people and always traveling in groups, but it was exhausting to me. I learned that I didn&rsquo;t need to act like an extrovert to be friends with the extroverts. I could say no to invitations that came my way without losing friendships. I could let my roommate know that I needed to go to bed at a reasonable hour instead of our room being the social hotspot. I could tell people when I needed a break or just needed some silence, and they would learn to understand. Trying to hide it or fake it or lie about it was helping no one&mdash;my being real and honest and transparent, in contrast, helped everyone.</p>
<p>Introverts, I know the world seems to rank us second-best. But here&rsquo;s the thing&mdash;we aren&rsquo;t any less than those who are more outspoken or expressive or action-packed. The world needs us to be really, truly, authentically us, and that comes from us being real with who we are, quiet and introspective and independent and all.</p>
