<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0029.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5501" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0029.jpg" alt="2013-11-11_0029" width="700" height="467" /></a>The excitement of a new job is unparalleled. Then one day you get to work, and the office coffee isn&rsquo;t quite as hot. Your boss doesn&rsquo;t seem so considerate, and you realize the funny guy in the department actually and truly laughs like a hyena. Each morning, you wake up less eager to pick out the perfect outfit for your brand-spanking-new career because it starts to feel more and more like&hellip; well, a job. What do you do? Do you change positions? Or do you change your attitude?</span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I faced this dilemma with my first job out of college, which I not so affectionately referred to as #MadMenLife, on Twitter and in person, to anyone who would listen. <em>&ldquo;Think of Mad Men, but without any of the cool, sexy parts,&rdquo;</em> is how I would describe it. To be fair, that&rsquo;s a pretty realistic description of what it was. Within about a month, my excitement from my first &ldquo;big girl job&rdquo; dwindled to mild enthusiasm. Is this the right fit for me? I asked myself that question over and over, knowing full well the answer.</span></p></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><em>Of course, I was excited to move on, but had I quit my job on day 30 or even day 300, I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned half the lessons I did through the whole experience. </em></p><br />
</blockquote></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another month went by, and I was positive of it &mdash; this job wasn&rsquo;t for me, and I deserved something better. After all, I had gone to college, paid a hefty tuition and done the hard work. Where was the reward of that dream job they said I&rsquo;d find?</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0033.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5502" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0033.jpg" alt="2013-11-11_0033" width="700" height="467" /></a>Major spoilers here: I ended up sticking with the &ldquo;Mad Men life&rdquo; for a year and a half before moving on to another position. Of course, I was excited to move on, but had I quit my job on day 30 or even day 300, I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned half the lessons I did through the whole experience. While I hoped to find a job that required&mdash;no&mdash;<i>demanded</i> I buy those Editor pants Express is always selling, the reality of my daily life was a bit more mundane, yet still valuable. I worked for a small company, so I was able to get my feet wet in design, copywriting, managing client relationships, and even video production &mdash; all of which have benefited me since. I learned how to communicate with a boss and coworkers, laughing-hyena quirks and all. More than anything, I realized that there&rsquo;s value to sticking with something when you feel like giving up.</span></p><br />
<span class="s1">Since that experience, I&rsquo;ve tried to remind myself not to give up on a job or feel entitled to move on when something doesn&rsquo;t go my way. The fact of the matter is things won&rsquo;t always go my way, and I have to be willing to grow through those experiences. I believe it&rsquo;s written on a poster in fifth grade classrooms, which validates its truth &mdash; you can&rsquo;t always control your circumstances, but you can control your attitude. </span></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a time to leave a job, but it&rsquo;s not always the time you might think. </span></h2></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&rsquo;s not the day you decide you don&rsquo;t like it. It&rsquo;s the day you realize you&rsquo;ve given it your all, learned everything you can from it, and have found a better opportunity to pour your hard work into.</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0026.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5500" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/2013-11-11_0026.jpg" alt="2013-11-11_0026" width="700" height="467" /></a>Of course, it&rsquo;s important to ask yourself what your dream job is, and having career goals is absolutely necessary to make progress. Looking back on that first job out of college, though, I wish I had spent more time eager to learn instead of just feeling eager to move on. Hold onto your dreams tightly enough so you don&rsquo;t lose sight of them, but loosely enough to value the progress you&rsquo;re making as you grit through a position that might not be ideal.</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every job in the world will carry its own set of problems and frustrations, so do what you can to have a positive attitude and view your challenges through bright, optimistic eyes. Make the best of every situation. At the end of the day, if your position isn&rsquo;t a stepping stone into that dream career, sure, consider leaving. But always consider whether you need a change in attitude before a change of setting.</span></p></p>
