Ahh, fall. It’s finally here! There is so much to love about it — the crisp air, the chunky sweaters, the pumpkin spice lattes. I love the feeling of fall and the way in which people tend to gather more to make the cooler weather cozier. And while the turning leaves seem to indicate the end of a life cycle for foliage, I’ve always associated fall with a new beginning; a time for re-invention or reflection. Part of that feeling always includes an urge to refresh my wardrobe with a few new pieces, change up my skin care routine, or update my home décor. So I’ve gathered up my favorite fall finds that make a difference — all pieces are from charitable, fair-trade, or socially conscious companies that make a positive impact.

### Fashion

#### 1.[The High Rise Jean in Lorena Wash](https://www.livefashionable.com/collections/denim/products/the-high-rise-lorena-wash) [by Fashionable](https://www.livefashionable.com/)

If comfy, stylish, and flattering jeans are your thing (and they should be), you won’t want to miss these jeans from Fashionable’s new denim line. The high-rise fit is super flattering and functional (allowing you to bend over without the dreaded gap in the back). Every pair of jeans is made by women who have overcome hardships and empowers them to earn a fair wage.

#### 2.[Luxe Wool Mockneck Sweater](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-luxe-wool-crop-mockneck-crimson?collection=womens-sweaters) [by Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/)

This red almost-turtleneck sweater from Everlane is substantial and perfect for a crisp fall day. The rich crimson color is on-trend this fall while also being a classic shade that will remain a staple in your wardrobe for years to come. Everlane apparel is ethically made, and the company donates Black Friday profits to improve the lives of the people who work at their factories. ![13 DO-GOOD PRODUCTS TO COZY UP WITH THIS FALL - YELLOW CO.](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2017/10/5f714142_adaa.jpg)

#### 3\. [Plaid Blanket Scarf](https://www.etsy.com/listing/506539088/blanket-scarf-plaid-oversized-poncho?ref=shop_home_active_24) by [Debrosse NYC](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DeBrosseNYC?ref=l2-shopheader-name)

Fall was made for plaid blanket scarves. My new favorite is from Debrosse — a New York City knitter who makes stunning scarves, hats, blankets, and more. For every purchase, 15% is donated to benefit Haitian orphans.

#### 4\. [The Clover Dress](https://www.krochetkids.org/shop/clover-dress/) by [Krochet Kids](https://www.krochetkids.org/)

For a versatile dress that can transition between seasons, I’m loving the new Clover Dress from Krochet Kids intl. Complete with pockets and a cut-out detail in the back, each dress is fairly made in Peru and signed by the woman who made it.

#### 5\. [Mariana Bucket Tote](https://www.livefashionable.com/collections/leather/products/mariana-bucket-tote?variant=68062314520) [by Fashionable](https://www.livefashionable.com/)

Again with the deep red, this bag is timeless and simultaneously trendy this season. I’m obsessed with it. (I have it in black, because I can’t commit to color.) If you want an updated look to a carry-anything tote, you’ll love the functionality this bag. Plus, each bag is made by women in Mexico who receive fair wages and job training.

#### **6.** [Chelsea Boots](https://nisolo.com/products/womens-chelsea-boot-black) [by Nisolo](https://nisolo.com/)

Who doesn’t love a Chelsea Boot? They’re functional and classic. And now, you can enjoy an ethically made version from Nisolo. All the makers of Nisolo goods receive above fair trade wages, healthcare, and a healthy working environment. ![13 DO-GOOD PRODUCTS TO COZY UP WITH THIS FALL - YELLOW CO.](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2017/10/6_ChelseaBoots_Nisolo.jpg)

#### 7\. [Michelle Clogs](https://www.fortressofinca.com/michelle-steel-grey/) by [Fortress of Inca](https://www.fortressofinca.com/)

Part mule, part clog - these shoes from Fortress of Inca are totally adorable. They’re hand-made in Peru with natural materials, and the makers receive fair wages.

#### 8\. [Coffee Tree Bracelet](https://www.societyb.com/products/coffee-tree-bracelet) [by Society B](https://www.societyb.com/)

Layering is still popular this season, and I love the simple, layered look of the Coffee Tree Bracelets from Kula Project, available at Society B. Each brass bangle provides a coffee tree for a woman in Rwanda, which provides a sustainable source of income for 30 years. Society B also donates 10% of the purchase price to charity.

### **Body**

#### 9\. [Lavender Bar Soap](https://www.handinhandsoap.com/collections/bar-soap/products/lavender-bar-soap-1) by [Hand in Hand Soap](https://www.handinhandsoap.com/)

Bar soap is making a huge comeback, because it generates less waste than bottled shower gel. Check out the bar soaps from Hand in Hand Soap for a palm-free, socially responsible bar soap. Not only do they smell amazing scents (lavender is my favorite for fall), but for every bar of soap purchased, Hand in Hand donates one bar of soap and a month of clean water to a child in need.

#### 10\. [Breathe Body Oil](https://erbaviva.com/collections/personal-care-spa/products/breathe-body-oil) [by Erbaviva](https://erbaviva.com/)

As the air gets cooler and dryer, replenish your skin with Erbaviva Breathe Body Oil. I love the freshness of this scent — a combination of spruce, eucalyptus, cedar, thyme, and tea tree organic essential oils. Erbaviva is dedicated to natural ingredients, and they donate to [The BlinkNow Foundation](http://www.blinknow.org/). ![13 DO-GOOD PRODUCTS TO COZY UP WITH THIS FALL - YELLOW CO.](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2017/10/10_BreatheBodyOil_Erbaviva.jpg)

### **Home**

#### 11\. [Chabi Ceramic Bowls](https://www.ravenandlily.com/chabi-ceramic-bowl/) [by Raven + Lily](https://www.ravenandlily.com/)

Dress up your tablescape for Thanksgiving with these stunning ceramic bowls in Moroccan patterns from Raven + Lily. The company donates 10% of sales of this collection to [Project Soar](http://www.projectsoarmorocco.org/), an after-school program empowering young girls in Morocco to continue their education.

#### 12\. [Spice Up Your Life Candle](https://www.societyb.com/collections/the-light-candle) [by Society B](https://www.societyb.com/)

This list wouldn’t be complete without a candle recommendation. (Full disclosure: I’m a little biased on this one.) The Spice Up Your Life Candle is the first seasonal scent from a new line called The Light Candle, which I created for Society B. Everything you love about the pumpkin spice latte (except the caffeine) is captured in this candle. Every candle is made from 100% soy wax, eco-friendly wicks that are lead and zinc-free, and a blend of phthalate-free essential oils and fragrance oils. Every purchase provides a donation to support refugees, and Society B gives 10% of your purchase price to charity.

#### 13\. [Lumbar Pillows](https://www.the-citizenry.com/collections/pillows/products/madera-lumbar-pillow) by [The Citizenry](https://www.the-citizenry.com/)

The newest trend in bedroom décor is also a convenient one: lumbar pillows. I love the styles from The Citizenry. This pillow is hand-woven and made by a fair trade cooperative in Oaxaca. For every pillow purchased, The Citizenry also donates one life-saving malaria-prevention bed net to [Nothing But Nets](https://nothingbutnets.net/). ![13 DO-GOOD PRODUCTS TO COZY UP WITH THIS FALL - YELLOW CO.](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2017/10/TheCitizerny_Holiday2016_OmbreLumbar_4_1024x1024.jpg) Tell us your favorite fall finds that make a difference! _Photos by [Marlena Pearl Photography](https://www.marlenapearlphotography.com/) and via [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/), [Nisolo](https://nisolo.com/), [Erbaviva](https://erbaviva.com/), and [The Citizenry](https://www.the-citizenry.com/)_[](https://www.instagram.com/society_b/)
