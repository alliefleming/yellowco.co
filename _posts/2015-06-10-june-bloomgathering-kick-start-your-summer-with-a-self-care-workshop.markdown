Super excited to announce our next [#bloomgathering](http://yellowconference.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1088&action=edit). This month we are hanging out with [Philosophie](http://www.thephilosophie.com/) founder, Sophie Jaffe. Sophie is going to be leading us through some self care tips along with a yoga class. The perfect way to jump start your health this summer.

We will be hanging out June 14th at HOWL in Long Beach. So you LB ladies- we're coming for you! Bring a friend and a yoga mat!

Can't wait to hang out and learn how to better ourselves inside and out!
