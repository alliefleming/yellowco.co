<p>If you're still debating on wether or not to attend The Yellow Conference, here's a bit more about the gathering to see if you're a good fit!</p>
<p>The Yellow Conference attendee is a creative lady who desires to live a whole hearted life. She is a designer, a photographer, a blogger, a stylist, a writer, a filmmaker. Whatever her craft she wants to use it for good. To change the world through her art. To make people smile, to change a life. In big ways and small. She is entrepreneurial minded, with a longing to make her craziest, biggest, scariest dreams a reality. She knows she was made for great things and desires the know-how to make these things happen. She is an artist. And she will change the world.</p>
