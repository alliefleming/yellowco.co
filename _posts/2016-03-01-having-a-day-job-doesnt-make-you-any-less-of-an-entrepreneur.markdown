<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_1-24.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5019" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_1-24.jpg" alt="Yellow_2015_Day_1-24" width="700" height="1050" /></a>When I first decided to start my own business in the fall of 2013, it was mostly because I dreamed of quitting my corporate job, becoming my own boss and designing projects the way I wanted. After several months, my wish was granted when the company I worked for folded without any warning.</p>
<h2><strong>I was forced into my dream job and I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what was to come.</strong></h2><br />
For seven months I worked as a full-time freelance designer and that was the most thrilling, yet terrifying time I've experienced thus far in my career. Success does not happen overnight, much to my dismay.</p>
<p>During that time, I moved away from everything I knew for the past seven years &ndash; my apartment, my friends and my community &ndash; and moved in with my parents. We held a yard sale where I sold some of my prized possessions, including MarioKart.</p>
<p>I expected work to come easily, because why not? I was formally trained and worked as a professional designer for a few years. After receiving my umpteenth rejection email I became defeated. One of the top retailers in the world wouldn&rsquo;t even hire me as a cashier.</p>

<h2><strong>Today, I&rsquo;m working full-time again while owning my side hustle. And I&rsquo;m okay with that.</strong></h2><br />
In the past two years, I learned there's immense value in working full-time (or even part-time) while pursuing your own business. For one, there's the security of a paycheck (and health insurance, if you&rsquo;re lucky.) There&rsquo;s freedom in investing money on training and networking opportunities that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend otherwise. You&rsquo;re able to learn new skills from your colleagues by observing their unique talents as you collaborate together.</p>

If you&rsquo;re currently working for the man, you'll have days where you feel overworked and undervalued. But before you jump the fence, I encourage you to think about the benefits of your current situation. What can you learn from your day job that you can apply to your business? You may surprise yourself!</p>
