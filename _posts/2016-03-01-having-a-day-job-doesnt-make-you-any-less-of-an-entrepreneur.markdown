  content: Absolutely agree, Holly!  When you want so much for your business to succeed
    but also need the security of a pay check, it can often be disheartening. But
    if you find that balance of entrepreneurship, while working, can be a beautiful,
    rewarding relationship.

  content: This was such a great post! And it's something that I think we need to
    remember. (I don't have a day job. My freelance business is my day job, but sometimes
    I feel like less of a businesswoman because I have kids and work from home while
    taking care of them.)

    I agree with you completely &ndash; the time it takes is the time it takes. No rushing, and no point in feeling bad about it.

    My path to freelancing was very similar. The first year was challenge after challenge: non-ideal clients, non-ideal projects, cutting down my expenses to bare necessities, owing my boyfriend rent money... it. was. hard.

    I applied for a teaching job, but I haven't heard back from the school for months &ndash; and when they finally did contact me, I was already making enough to actually not *need* the job. I took it up part-time anyway, just to get some new experience. We'll see where that takes me :)

    part time job helps you out and allows you to do the creative work you love, without
    being so financially stressed :) Good luck!!

  content: "Such great points you make! For much of the past year and a half, I did
    feel like I was stuck between two worlds -- working my day job full time (now
    part time) and growing my business nights and weekends.  In just a few months,
    I'll be making the leap into full time entrepreneurship after slowly transitioning
    out of my career.  \n\nYay for side hustles! Doing this at my own pace and staying
    in my day job helped keep my sanity, let me focus on creating a solid foundation
    in my own business, and not feel anxious about the money side of things."

  content: I'm working full-time as a college administrator, which is what I went
    to grad school to do... but after following my partner for a job, I ended up in
    one that wasn't really my thing. I figured it was just for a year or two while
    I found something else... and nothing else has really come up! It's been hard,
    and now due to being short staffed things are even more stressful (i.e. less of
    what I like about my job, more of what needs done). I remind myself to be grateful
    in this economy to have a decent income, but.... that doesn't mean I have to completely
    settle for it. I'm working hard at my own side gigs to make sure even if I don't
    have my dream job soon, I'm at least working toward it every day. Thank you for
    sharing this - it was great to feel read that having this day job doesn't make
    me less of a creative.

  content: LOVED this post.  I completely agree and while I am a full-time self-employed
    jewellery designer, I have a lot of friends who struggle with the idea that just
    because they still have a day job they are "not as successful."  It breaks my
    heart.  Everyone finds their own path and having a day job certainly does not
    make one less successful than anyone else.

  content: Thank you for this! This is needed when the current message pushed, especially
    on social media, is that either quit your job and flail at your own businesses
    or you aren't living right.

After several months, my wish was granted when the company I worked for folded without any warning.</p>
<h2><strong>I was forced into my dream job and I wasn&rsquo;t prepared for what was to come.</strong></h2><br />
For seven months I worked as a full-time freelance designer and that was the most thrilling, yet terrifying time I've experienced thus far in my career. Success does not happen overnight, much to my dismay.</p>
<p>During that time, I moved away from everything I knew for the past seven years &ndash; my apartment, my friends and my community &ndash; and moved in with my parents. We held a yard sale where I sold some of my prized possessions, including MarioKart.</p>
<p>I expected work to come easily, because why not? I was formally trained and worked as a professional designer for a few years. After receiving my umpteenth rejection email I became defeated. One of the top retailers in the world wouldn&rsquo;t even hire me as a cashier.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_1-55.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5020" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_1-55.jpg" alt="Yellow_2015_Day_1-55" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<h2><strong>Today, I&rsquo;m working full-time again while owning my side hustle. And I&rsquo;m okay with that.</strong></h2><br />
In the past two years, I learned there's immense value in working full-time (or even part-time) while pursuing your own business. For one, there's the security of a paycheck (and health insurance, if you&rsquo;re lucky.) There&rsquo;s freedom in investing money on training and networking opportunities that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to attend otherwise. You&rsquo;re able to learn new skills from your colleagues by observing their unique talents as you collaborate together.</p>
<h2><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_2-193.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5018" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Yellow_2015_Day_2-193.jpg" alt="Yellow_2015_Day_2-193" width="700" height="1050" /></a>Your day job doesn&rsquo;t make you any less of an entrepreneur.</strong></h2><br />
If you&rsquo;re currently working for the man, you'll have days where you feel overworked and undervalued. But before you jump the fence, I encourage you to think about the benefits of your current situation. What can you learn from your day job that you can apply to your business? You may surprise yourself!</p>
