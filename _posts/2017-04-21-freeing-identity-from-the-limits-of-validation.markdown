<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My entire life, I have based important decisions on what others told me I was good at.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My teachers, family, supervisors, and every personality test made a point of praising me for my organization, writing, and outrageous work ethic. I was a straight A student growing up, and spent many of my early adult years chasing those gold stars I&rsquo;d grown accustomed to. My choice of college, the debate over career opportunities, and even my own sense of identity were all wrapped up in those tasks I excelled at. <em>The things I did well defined&nbsp;who I was </em>- and&nbsp;I genuinely believed this was the way everyone lived. </span><i>&nbsp;</i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, several transitional years later, <strong>I hold a fierce and controversial belief: if you want to be happier, quit just doing the things you&rsquo;re &lsquo;good&rsquo; at.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it sounds blasphemous - but hear me out. I spent many years confusing excelling at something for&nbsp;genuine passion. I thought (and I don&rsquo;t think I was alone in this) that if I built a career around tasks that were easy for me to complete, well, I&rsquo;d be happy. I</span>t turns out that being proficient in a job is not the same thing as being passionate about it, regardless of how many accolades&nbsp;you receive.<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;I finally understood that this is why so many of my new career adventures didn&rsquo;t light me up! It was like I was cooking dinner with the same three ingredients, <em>night after night</em>. Although the presentation was different, it all tasted the same - and none of it was fulfilling or exciting.</span></p>
<h3><strong>One day, I woke up to the realization that I wasn&rsquo;t being proactive about creating the skills I needed to live the life I wanted. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This was a major shift for me. Instead of desperately trying to create an exciting position out of the skills I already possessed, <strong>it occurred to me that I could tap into an&nbsp;infinite capacity to learn something new.</strong>&nbsp;While I can't pinpoint exactly when&nbsp;I began to believe that the abilities&nbsp;I was recognized for were all I would ever have, I know it happened early on in life. I had unknowingly put myself inside of a box, and now, I was no longer comfortable there. It was time for a change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make this transformation, I had to embrace&nbsp;being a beginner again. I still used the expertise&nbsp;I&rsquo;d developed throughout my life, but rather than allowing&nbsp;it to&nbsp;limit my career, I utilized it&nbsp;as a starting point. I stopped working outrageously hard in a dead-end corporate job so I could use that work ethic for myself. I stopped organizing everyone else&rsquo;s work, and focused on&nbsp;my own. <strong>Most importantly, I sought to understand myself outside of the traits&nbsp;I&rsquo;d been praised for and defined by.</strong> I recognized what&nbsp;I actually enjoyed doing, and started to intentionally flex those muscles instead. With time and attention, those muscles started to strengthen, and became new skills of their own.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, my career and life are built around what I love.</span></p>
<h3><strong>When we stop limiting ourselves to simply what others tell us we're good at, we free up the space to chase endless new ideas, concepts, and dreams.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After all, being an expert&nbsp;at something is&nbsp;only the&nbsp;result of repetition and practice. With time, you can understand and excel at whatever you commit to. I may not receive as many gold stars these days, but I am free from&nbsp;looking for external validation. Instead, I&rsquo;m immensely proud of my work, I love what I do, and I spend every day growing. And that&rsquo;s worth a hell of a lot of gold stars, if you ask me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be encouraged and inspired to step outside of your&nbsp;comfort zone and into the unknown. It is never too late in life to try something radically new if it&rsquo;s in the pursuit of a dream. Know you are just as smart, capable, and full of infinite possibility as anyone else. So, stop doing the things you&rsquo;re good at if they&nbsp;don&rsquo;t bring you joy, focus on the legacy you want to leave, and quit limiting your own growth by accepting the validation of others as truth. The only voice&nbsp;that you are obligated to listen to is your own.</span></p>
