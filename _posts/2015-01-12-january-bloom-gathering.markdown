<p>It's here! Our January Bloom Gathering will be happening on the 19th at 7:30pm at <a href="http://www.communal-la.com/" target="_blank">Communal LA</a>. Bloom Gatherings are our monthly hang outs where we do anything and everything from <a href="http://yellowconference.com/category/bloom-for-hope/" target="_blank">raising money for a cause</a>, or simply have a <a href="http://yellowconference.com/december-bloom-gathering-recap/" target="_blank">holiday party</a>. They are great ways to get out of the house, get inspired and connected with women who truly want the best for you and your creative career and endeavors.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/JANUARY_BLOOMGATHERING.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1670" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/JANUARY_BLOOMGATHERING.jpg" alt="JANUARY_BLOOMGATHERING" width="700" height="1035" /></a></p>
<p>For this gathering, we will be going through "START" by <a href="http://www.stilettosontherocks.com/" target="_blank">Krysta Masciale</a> and <a href="http://work.ruthiauda.com/" target="_blank">Ruthi Auda</a>. (You can read all about START&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stilettosontherocks.com/start-your-quarterly-guide-to-goal-domination/" target="_blank">here</a>, the full book will be available for sale at our gathering, and a smaller printed version comes with your ticket.) We will be&nbsp;walking through how to set realistic, tangible goals you can feel good about and actually achieve. All while hanging with like-minded women, sipping wine, snacking and hanging in the beautiful space that is <a href="http://www.communal-la.com/" target="_blank">Communal LA</a>. (Go check out their site- the place is gorgeous!)</p>
<p><a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/januarybloomgathering" target="_blank">Tickets are $18</a> and includes the goal workshop, drinks, light snacks, printed goodies and a network of awesomely creative women who desire to use their gifts for good.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us! Grab your ticket <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/januarybloomgathering" target="_blank">here</a>, and to see past gatherings <a href="http://yellowconference.com/category/bloom-gatherings/" target="_blank">head here</a>.</p>
