<h4><strong>Our kids&hellip;</strong></h4><br />
Our plan never included foster care. I always thought it was too messy, too hard, that I&rsquo;d get too attached. Then we saw their faces...we learned their names, we heard their stories, and everything changed. They didn&rsquo;t choose to be here [in foster care]. They didn&rsquo;t choose to be taken from all they&rsquo;ve ever known, thrown into a house full of strangers, a house that feels nothing like home to them. <strong>We couldn&rsquo;t say no. We realized that these kids are our kids, they are our&nbsp;responsibility, all of ours.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I want to share the good and hard parts of our journey, and hopefully in doing that I can help debunk the myths and misunderstandings most people hold about foster care.</span></em></blockquote><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">They may go through life seen by the world as a label &ndash; a foster kid &ndash; a nameless, faceless statistic with a sad story. Their stories are ones that make people pause when they see it on the news, but stories that everyone thinks someone else will take care of.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3552" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-3.jpg" alt="yellow conference blog foster care" width="700" height="700" /></a></p>
<p><strong>These kids are ours. They are wanted.</strong> They are cherished. They are loved. They may only stay one week, or they may stay forever; no matter how long it is, they will know love. Most of my days look pretty ordinary. They are filled with naps, bottles, yoga pants, spit up and diapers; but through all of it I am learning to love deeper. I am learning to love with no guarantee of tomorrow.</p>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">I don&rsquo;t want to spend my life holding my heart intact - I want to spread it all over, let it break into a million pieces, and send a part of it with every child and family we encounter. These kids, these families, they deserve that.</span></p>
<h4>Our hope&hellip;</h4><br />
Our hope is that the joy of loving and providing a safe and stable home for children outweighs the gripping fear of losing them.</p>
<p>Our hope is that thousands of loving families will step into this work: the work of healing and reconciliation among those most ignored by our society.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-9.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3558" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-9.jpg" alt="yellow conference blog: foster care" width="700" height="700" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Our hope is that foster care will work</strong> &ndash; that generational cycles of abuse, addiction and poverty will be broken, and that through healing, families will be able to stay in tact.</p>
<p>Our hope is that people can see these children for what they are. They may have the label of &ldquo;foster kid,&rdquo; a label that comes with a lot of baggage and misunderstandings. <strong><em>But these are precious children</em>:&nbsp;</strong>they are strong, they have just had an unfair lot handed to them. They are not invisible. They are ours.</p>

<h4><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Our story...<br />
<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3557" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-8.jpg" alt="yellow conference foster care post" width="700" height="700" /></a></span></h4><br />
I may not be able to share their names or faces, and their story is theirs alone to tell, but I am working to find a way to share our story as foster parents. <strong>Storytelling changes hearts, and it ultimately changes the world.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3559" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/foster-care-post-10.jpg" alt="yellow conference blog: foster care" width="700" height="700" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I believe that in sharing our story we can help to humanize foster care.</strong> There are nearly 30,000 kids in foster care in Los Angeles alone, and I believe the world needs to see that those are real children, not just numbers on a page. I want to share the good and hard parts of our journey, and hopefully in doing that I can help debunk the myths and misunderstandings most people hold about foster care. The journey may not be glamorous, it is definitely filled with a whole lot of ordinary and hard days, but this is right where we are supposed to be, and I want to share that. You can follow our family's journey on Instagram (<a href="https://instagram.com/designatedstrangers/" target="_blank">@designatedstrangers</a>).</p>
<p><strong><em>Here are three ways @designatedstrangers uses instagram to educate:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. She invites followers to share their journey&nbsp;</strong>by asking questions in her caption and broadening conversation.</p>
<p><strong>2. She keeps it simple and informative&nbsp;</strong>by addressing the questions she has received most as a foster mom and providing resources to followers.</p>
<p><strong>3. She gracefully shares her journey&nbsp;</strong>through stories, pictures, and her own learning experiences.</p>
