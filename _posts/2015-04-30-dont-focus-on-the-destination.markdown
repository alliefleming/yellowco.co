Thursday. This day can mean many things to many people. For most, Thursday is just a means to an end. Friday, of course, being the end.

Now down't get me wrong, we all love a little TGIF, but I think a lot of times the way we view Thursday is how a lot of us look at our lives. We get stuck into this mindset that everything we're doing, each phase of life is a means to an end. You're only working this job until you land your dream job. You're only going on this run so you can loose those last 5 pounds. You're only living in this tiny apartment until you can afford something nicer.

Too many times we get caught up in this “arrival complex” mentality. We think “if only I did this, or just wait until I do this, then life will be better, then I will be known, then people will look at me with respect…blah blah..” when in reality, it’s just NOT TRUE.

The destination is _not_ the thing that is going to fulfill us. Stepping out of our comfort zones and following your dreams is one of the best ways to become a better, stronger human being- and _that_ is why you should do it- not because you think the destination is going to fulfill you. Living a life filled with passion helps us become better mothers, friends, better spouses and it helps us get to know ourselves better and find what we are capable of. You'll find it's empowering to see how you can survive hardships and come out the other end a better person than before.

There's a reason the world is filled with apathetic, lazy people. It's EASIER to live that way. Getting up and doing something is HARD. It takes guts, strength, endurance and resilience.

You WILL experience hardships. We live in a broken world. But how you handle those hardships are what will shape you into the person you will become.

THIS is the most rewarding part of being an entrepreneur and following your passion. Don’t get caught up with the arrival complex. You have already arrived.

So instead of wishing away those pounds every mile of that run, enjoy the journey. Look at your surroundings. Feel your heart. It's pumping blood throughout your body- reminding you that you are alive. Instead of wishing you had that dream job, do your best where you are at now. Be thankful for the work you do have and give it all you got. Instead of longing for a nicer place to live, embrace the years you have in the tiny place you have now. One day you'll look back on these days and remember how free you were without a big mortgage or property taxes!

So this Thursday, be thankful. Don't wish it away. Life is not about the destination, it's about the journey. Embrace it! And have a good one ladies!
