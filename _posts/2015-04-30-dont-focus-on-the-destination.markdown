<p>Thursday. This day can mean many things to many people.&nbsp;For most, Thursday is just a means to an end.&nbsp;Friday, of course, being the end.</p>
<p>Now down't get me wrong, we all love a little TGIF, but I think a lot of times the way we view Thursday is how a lot of us look at our lives. We get stuck into this mindset that everything we're doing, each phase of life is a means to an end. You're only working this job until you&nbsp;land&nbsp;your dream job. You're only going on this run so you can loose those last 5 pounds. You're only living in this tiny apartment until you&nbsp;can afford something nicer.</p>
<p>Too many times we get caught up in this &ldquo;arrival complex&rdquo; mentality. We think &ldquo;if only I did this, or just wait until I do this, then life will be better, then I will be known, then people will look at me with respect&hellip;blah blah..&rdquo; when in reality, it&rsquo;s just NOT TRUE.</p>
<p>The destination is <em>not</em>&nbsp;the thing that is going to fulfill&nbsp;us. Stepping out of our comfort zones and following your dreams is one of the best ways to become a better, stronger human being- and<em> that</em> is why you should do it- not because you think the destination is going to fulfill you. Living a life filled with passion&nbsp;helps us become better mothers, friends, better spouses and it helps us get to know ourselves better and find what we are capable of. You'll find it's&nbsp;empowering to see how you&nbsp;can survive hardships and come out the other end a better person&nbsp;than before.</p>
<p>There's a reason the world is filled with apathetic, lazy people. It's EASIER to live that way. Getting up and doing something is HARD. It takes guts, strength, endurance and resilience.</p>
<p>You WILL&nbsp;experience hardships. We live in a broken world. But how you handle those hardships are what will shape you into the person you will become.</p>
<p>THIS is the most rewarding part of being an entrepreneur and following your passion. Don&rsquo;t get caught up with the arrival complex.&nbsp;You have already arrived.</p>
<p>So instead of wishing away those pounds every mile of that run, enjoy the journey. Look at your surroundings. Feel your heart. It's pumping blood throughout your body- reminding&nbsp;you that you are alive. Instead of wishing you had that&nbsp;dream job, do your best where you are at now. Be thankful for the work&nbsp;you do have and give it all you got. Instead of longing for a nicer place to live, embrace the years you have in the tiny place you have&nbsp;now.&nbsp;One day you'll look back on these days and remember how free you were without a big mortgage or property taxes!</p>
<p>So this Thursday, be thankful. Don't wish it away. Life is not about the destination, it's about the journey.&nbsp;Embrace it! And have a good one ladies!</p>
