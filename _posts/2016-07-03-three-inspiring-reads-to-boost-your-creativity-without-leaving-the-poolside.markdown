So whatever you are doing this fine three day weekend, we hope you find it restful. And what better way to rest with a little inspirational reads by the pool, or the air conditioner, or&nbsp;on your patio, drinking some mint watermelon lemonade (or whatever your heart desires)?!</p>
<p>Here are some of our faves:</p>

<h4><em>For the Activist...</em></h4><br />
<a href="http://consciousmagazine.co/women-philanthropy-making-a-difference/" target="_blank">Read this article</a> on how girls and women of all status are changing the face of philanthropy...Here's a little preview:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>As women entrepreneurs told me when being interviewed for my first book, Transformational Philanthropy: Entrepreneurs and Nonprofits, philanthropy is more than just donating money. It is a hug, a smile, holding the door open for someone, helping them carry in their groceries, shoveling their walk, etc. In other words, women saw philanthropy on a continuum with many opportunities or points for intersection not simply donating money.</em></blockquote></p>
<h4><em>For the Starter...</em></h4><br />

<p>So put up your feet, grab your iPad or phone and enjoy the sun all the while infusing creativity to kick off your week on the right start. No matter who you are or what you do, your creativity never takes a break, even if your work schedule does.</p>
<h4><em>Just for fun...</em></h4><br />
