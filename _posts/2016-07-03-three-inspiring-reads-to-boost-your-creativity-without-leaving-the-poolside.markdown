So whatever you are doing this fine three day weekend, we hope you find it restful. And what better way to rest with a little inspirational reads by the pool, or the air conditioner, or on your patio, drinking some mint watermelon lemonade (or whatever your heart desires)?!

Here are some of our faves:

#### _For the Solopreneur..._

#### _For the Leader..._

Their using their skills both the creative industry and psychology, life coaching, and more to bring the good news of self-care to those living in the hustle. [Read this post](http://www.thebraveryboard.com/blog/june-recap) about taking a break from goals to pursue being the best you _(even you deserve a break sometimes, boss-lady)_.

#### _For the Activist..._

[Read this article](http://consciousmagazine.co/women-philanthropy-making-a-difference/) on how girls and women of all status are changing the face of philanthropy...Here's a little preview:

> _As women entrepreneurs told me when being interviewed for my first book, Transformational Philanthropy: Entrepreneurs and Nonprofits, philanthropy is more than just donating money. It is a hug, a smile, holding the door open for someone, helping them carry in their groceries, shoveling their walk, etc. In other words, women saw philanthropy on a continuum with many opportunities or points for intersection not simply donating money._

#### _For the Starter..._

Think volunteering is a waste of time? Think again...[Here's a post](http://yellowconference.com/2016/06/23/building-your-dreams-by-saying-yes-to-volunteer-work/) on how volunteering can put you on the right track for your dream career.

So put up your feet, grab your iPad or phone and enjoy the sun all the while infusing creativity to kick off your week on the right start. No matter who you are or what you do, your creativity never takes a break, even if your work schedule does.

#### _Just for fun..._

The amazing Becky Simpson just came out with a hilarious and fun book called "[The Roommate Book](https://www.amazon.com/Roommate-Book-Sharing-Lives-Slapping/dp/1449470904)". It's filled with witty humor, quizzes and fun illustrations, all surrounding  the ropoc of the roommate experience. A perfect poolside read.
