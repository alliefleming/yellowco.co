_These are just a few of the straight-to-the-point, inspirational mantras that make up the [Tribe of Dreamers](http://www.tribeofdreamers.co/0jzdkwvg6pwgozqhjjb2mmdr5evnsp) mission. They use their beautiful, LA based (hello, #consciousclosets!) and hand crafted jewelry to communicate a message of inspiration to their buyers. Partnering with relief organizations like [Reach Out Worldwide](http://www.tribeofdreamers.co/reach-out-worldwide/), founders Annie and Jen have nailed it when it comes to quality, taste, branding, and form, all the while using their efforts for the greater good. _

###### **What was your first step to starting TOD? Practically speaking...**

We just made it a point to meet a few times a week.  We would have conversations about our desires, what we want to see happen in the world, how we could use what we love to end something we hate. We started brainstorming what we wanted our company to look like and it organically formed from there.

###### **Have you both always been business minded? Have you always had a desire to start your own company? **

**We can safely say no.**  Both of us had started and ran our own companies on our own. Annie, making wedding cakes and Jen making jewelry. Both of us didn't enjoy the process of working solo and wanted to do it with someone else. When we met we felt like it was a natural fit and we were so open to starting a company together even though we were practically strangers. We both have always had the desire to start our own business and create something that was truly meaningful. Neither of us are good at doing things we don't love.

###### **What would you say to dreamers out there who want to use their work for good? What piece of advice do you have to share with them? **

Make a list of the good you want to see done - if this is hard to pinpoint, think about the things in this world that you feel most angry or upset about - and then write down what you are passionate about  and what your values are. See if there are any creative connections between the three. Anything that you plan or comes across you, if it does not fall in line with that vision, don't do it.  **In other words: stay true to who you are and where your heart resides. **

###### **What have you seen accomplished through Tribe of Dreamers? How is your mantra and message displayed in your business? **

We feel our greatest accomplishment is getting to work with the people and non-profits (Yellow Conference is definitely one of these!) that we've gotten to partner with. Our partners and artist collaborators are all so inspiring, talented and have such beautiful visions for the future, and it's so humbling and exciting to get to collaborate together. Our mantra is designed into everyone of our products, and we hope our message is communicated though the words that are on our jewelry.

###### **How did you decide which organizations to partner with? **

The organizations that fall in line with our values and things we are passionate about. And honestly, we're big feelers, so we tend to go with things that give us goosebumps.

###### What are your dreams? What do you dream for Tribe of Dreamers?

That is a difficult question.  We have so many dreams!! One of our overall dreams for TOD is that someone would feel encouraged when wearing our jewelry and perhaps have the courage to start something new that changes the world for the better.
