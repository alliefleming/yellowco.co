Hey Yellow ladies! Joanna Waterfall here, coming to this blog of ours to ask you for some help!</p>
<p>We want to get to know our audience (you!) better and have created a little <a href="https://joannawaterfall.typeform.com/to/yQiayj" target="_blank">survey</a> with some "get to know you" questions that we'd love for you to fill out.</p>
<p>Now, we all know surveys are the last thing we want to be spending our precious time doing, sooo to make it WORTH your time, filling out the survey will enter you into a random drawing to win a ticket to Yellow Conference 2016 (happening August 25th &amp; 26th 2016) along with a <a href="https://yellowco.myshopify.com/products/bloom-key-the-giving-keys-collaboration" target="_blank">"Bloom" Giving Key</a> from our conference this year!</p>
<h4><a href="https://joannawaterfall.typeform.com/to/yQiayj" target="_blank">To enter, fill out the survey here.</a></h4><br />
It shouldn't take you any longer than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The winner will be announced next Tuesday morning and contacted through email.</p>
<p>Thanks ladies-&nbsp;enjoy your Tuesday!</p>
<p>PS- Tickets sales for Yellow 2016 will open up December 1st. The dates are August 25th and 26th, and the conference will be happening in LA.&nbsp;Mark your calendars- it's going to be good!!</p>
