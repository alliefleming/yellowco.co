<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><br />
You, you&rsquo;re a revolution.</strong><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A red-violet, hint of indigo,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unnamed shade of excellence.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spark, maybe silent,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to ignite a wildfire dream. </span></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>She, she&rsquo;s the wind.</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">An effortless glow<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of iridescent yellow.<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Water to the desert deep in our soul,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mighty whisper to our doubt.</span></span></span></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Together, every hand is outreached.</strong><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each heavy head never falls<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">without a shoulder to lean on.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our collective heart beats &ldquo;you are seen&rdquo;,<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">our gaze is on the unveiled good. </span></span></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 19th century, years before women had the right to vote - or do much else for that matter, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosopher and poet </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Matthew Arnold </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke in recognition and reverence of the power of united women:</span></p><br />
<b><i>&ldquo;If there ever comes a time when the women of the world come together purely and simply for the benefit of mankind, it will be a force such as the world has never known.&rdquo;</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some days, this vision feels right at our fingertips. On others, it slips through our lonely hands like water. We all know the corrosive bite of being compared to other women - whether done by ourselves or society. It grows a divide between us from fear, insecurity, or simply the premature conclusion that we are too different to understand each other. </span></p>
<h3><strong>It intimidates us into desperately clutching onto our gifts, rather than sharing them where they can collaboratively flourish.</strong></h3><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, I hope you have also known the head-to-toe sigh of receiving an earnest &ldquo;me too&rdquo;. Or even better, experienced the empathy that can&rsquo;t understand, but listens wholeheartedly anyway. Of marching side by side, and intently slowing enough to notice the distinct glimmer behind each other&rsquo;s eyes.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Our complexities were not designed for division, but completion. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This justice we crave, the wholeness we desire, it takes full form only when we are unified. We must actively choose to break down barriers not just for our own inner freedom, but for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the good of the world</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Because when our focus is freed from ourselves, we can change everything for someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month, we are here to </span><b>Come Together</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. To humanize those that seem far from us. To lean in and listen to opinions we disagree with. To discover the groundbreaking, far fetched visions that come to fruition when we work as one. I encourage you to turn off your tunnel vision. Speak to the strangers you pass on the street. Open your imagination to the possibilities to come when we, in all our diversity, put each other first.</span></p>
