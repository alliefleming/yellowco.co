Starting **today,** we are going to be introducing you to one of our team members every Tuesday...These are the gals with late night dreams about all things Yellow, and we think it's time for you to get to know us on a real level...So, join us, as we show you (through selfies, iPhone pics, and short commentaries) the unglamorous, untouched, _authentic_ (there's that word again!), exceptionally normal parts of our days!

What better way to start this "mini series" than with Yellow's visionary and founder: Joanna Waterfall...

**After getting out of bed--the first thing I do is make coffee. Can't go far without that. Then I feed the cats and get myself ready for the day!**

**Next I head to my office and get started on work! Most days are spent here with client meetings, phone meetings, and getting stuff done with the occasional coffee break. **
