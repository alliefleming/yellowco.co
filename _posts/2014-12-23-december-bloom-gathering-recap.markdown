<p>This month's gathering was full of Christmas cheer, bubbly, and shopping with a cause. We partnered with <span style="color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffcc00;" href="http://www.shareanddogood.com/learn/" target="_blank">Share and Do Good</a></span>: an&nbsp;<strong>adorable&nbsp;and conscious&nbsp;</strong>shop in the heart of downtown Fullerton that offers sustainable products that tell a story, support a cause, and do good around the world. We were super excited to discover this gem, and even more excited to support socially-conscious Christmas shopping all the while mingling with some of our favorite gals.</p>

<p>The night was full of connecting with women from all over Orange and Los Angeles County, sharing snacks and drinks potluck style, and hearing the story of Share and Do Good from the owner, Lilly. There was an excited buzz around the shop as the Christmas tree was lit, the table full of treats, and everyone gathered around the different goodies by some of our favorite brands like Sevenly, The Giving Keys, 31 Bits, and Krochet Kids.</p>

<p>We listened to each others dreams, shopped together, laughed together, and found common ground in a rooted desire to see good spread throughout the world. By shopping at Share and Do Good, we supported a variety of causes, from providing a night of shelter for an orphan (<a href="http://www.bridgewatercandles.com/light-a-candle-feed-a-child.aspx" target="_blank">Bridewater Candles</a>) or buying a box of socially conscious goods (<a href="https://causebox.sevenly.org/" target="_blank">Causebox by Sevenly</a>)-and, to top off the night, we collected a table full of toys for Toys for Tots!</p>
