<p>If you haven't heard by now, The Yellow Collective is o-to-the-pen. Wide open until the 31st. That means this is your chance to join the COOLEST group of women I've ever had the chance of getting to know. The Yellow Collective members aren't you're average "women in business" kind of gals. The women&nbsp;in our community are&nbsp;fiercely passionate, extraordinarily creative, beautifully brave, aaaand&nbsp;they have a deep desire, a hunger even, to serve something bigger than themselves, to make the world a better place, to spread goodness, and come fully ALIVE.</p>
<p>How POWERFUL is that?? Let me just tell you, when these women come together, BIG things happen. Like, world changing stuff.</p>
<p>Instead of talking your ear off about how cool our members are, I thought it would be fun for you to hear directly from them about who they are and what they're experience has been in the Collective. Sound good?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shayarees/" target="_blank">Shaya Rees</a>&nbsp;is an administrative assistant at the <a href="http://negu.org/" target="_blank">Jessie Rees Foundation</a> and one of the most motivated young creatives we&rsquo;ve met. I mean, this girl is using her gifts to make the world truly a better place.</p>
<h3><strong>&ldquo;<a href="http://yellowcollective.co/" target="_blank">The Yellow Collective</a> has been the greatest blessing in my life lately,&rdquo; she said.</strong></h3><br />
&ldquo;<strong><em>I have an incredible group of women who encourage me, push me, teach me, and share their wisdom. It&rsquo;s a place where I feel safe and know that I can be vulnerable&hellip; They teach me to be myself, trust the path that I am on, and never stop pursing [my] dreams!"</em></strong></p>
<p>How cool is that??</p>

<p>Another one of our members, Cassidy Perry, is a social media coach and web manager. She told us that the Collective has been a &ldquo;wonderful and delightful surprise&rdquo; that didn&rsquo;t fit the traditional networking model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em><strong>What I found was genuinely caring young women who care about helping each other grow in all areas of life and business,</strong></em>&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;<em><strong>&ldquo;This is truly a unique group of women who don&rsquo;t just talk about supporting each other but truly show up and are there for each other&hellip;I&rsquo;ve gained confidence that business can be done with vulnerability and kindness. You don&rsquo;t have to be cutthroat to succeed."</strong></em></p>
<p>The Collective is definetly a "you get out of it what you put into it" type of membership, even though it can be scary to share who you are and put yourself out there.&nbsp;Collective member&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/flyingfreediaries/" target="_blank">Zantika Ellis</a> reminded us that it&rsquo;s SO worth it.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;<strong>I&rsquo;ve learned to step out of my comfort zone and to be okay with the anxiety that comes with doing so,</strong>&rdquo; she said.</h3><br />
Stepping out and moving despite the fear and anxiety that comes? Zantika is the definition of a girlboss. I told you these ladies were cool.</p>
<p>We send out quarterly "Empowerment Boxes" with our all-access membership. It's so much fun to see our members <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/yellowcollective/" target="_blank">post about them on&nbsp;Instagram</a>&nbsp;and see how much joy these boxes bring... not to mention all the goodness inside.</p>
<p>Sara Fitzgerald, one of our members, said, <em><strong>&ldquo;That box was like a ray of sunshine sitting on my porch, full of things to inspire, resources, and wisdom!&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
<p>Every Wednesday evening, we host a Slack Chat on a different topic. We&rsquo;ve discussed creativity, vulnerability, boundaries &mdash; you name it! No matter where our members are, the chats offer a place to connect on a regular basis.</p>
<p><em><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gained a strong sense of community from our weekly Slack Chats as we shower each other with encouragement, wisdom, and tools to utilize in our everyday lives,&rdquo;</strong> </em>shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/britneylclark/" target="_blank">Britney Clark</a>, a speaker and financial professional. <strong>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ve learned we&rsquo;re all connected in some way."</em></strong></p>
<p>I do this because I believe that&nbsp;there's SO much to be learned, gained, and experienced by purposeful&nbsp;women coming together. We not only can grow in our character and in our creative endeavors, but we can truly impact the world for the better. What an honor to be apart of something like this.</p>
<p>We would love to have you join us as a Collective member this quarter. If you have any questions, shoot an email over to rachel@yellowco.co.</p>
