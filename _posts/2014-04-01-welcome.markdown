Hello dear.

We're so happy you're here. Yellow is a Conference meant for women who want to change the world for the better. We want so much more than just an awesome paycheck, more than just individual satisfaction. We want to use our talents, use our gifts to make this world a better place, and we want to be empowered! As women, we have a unique strength, that has such power to accomplish and do amazing things. Together we can change the world.

We are starting this blog as a platform to converse about subjects surrounding this topic. We will have interviews with amazing people doing amazing things around the globe. We will have updates and information about the conference coming this August. We might give away a ticket or two! But please, check back here once a week for something fun from us to you.

Also, don't forget to [register today](#want-to-join-us) for the Yellow Conference! August 28th and 29th in LA!
