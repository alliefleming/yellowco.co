<p><strong>You know those types of days&mdash;the ones when you&rsquo;re <i>sure</i> you can&rsquo;t do anything more than you have already done. Your feet hurt (leave the dishes) your eyes hurt (turn down the brightness on that computer screen!) and you&rsquo;ve exhausted everything in yourself and can&rsquo;t possibly move on! <em>Okay everyone, hold on a second. </em></strong></p>
<p> Is where you are in your career and life&nbsp;<em>right now</em> where you want to be next year? Humans thrive on forward motion, so I will assume you&rsquo;re working to make next year&rsquo;s you an even better version of who you are now. &nbsp;My last post was about  <a href="http://yellowco.co/creative-ladies/how-to-create-a-vision-plan-that-works-for-you/"> vision planning. </a>  &nbsp;The key to getting to the extracurriculars is to set aside time to get them done, and this post is going to tell you just how to do exactly that. &nbsp;<a href="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Yellow2016-184.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7817" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Yellow2016-184.jpg" alt="yellow2016-184" width="2400" height="3600" /></a>  The business extracurriculars are the essential ingredients to you and your business&rsquo; growth.   That thing you&rsquo;ve been meaning to get to is the thing that will propel you beyond where you are today.  </p>
<h3><b>1 &mdash; Create and honor space </b></h3><br />
Don&rsquo;t over do it. 1-2 extra hours is plenty of time to create a dent. Plan the time the same way you would plan your work and from there honor yourself and the precious time you set aside to execute.</p>
<p> For example, if I decide that I absolutely need to take a Saturday morning to write an extra blog post, I better do it instead of procrastinating the day away. This is harder than it sounds and takes  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Habit-Learn-Use-Life/dp/1480589837?ref_=nav_signin&amp;"> a creative habit </a>  to help productivity. </p>
<p><i> Hot tip:  </i> Use a timer or set a lunch date to put pressure on yourself to get it done. Humans are funny creatures and we respond well to pressure and limits. Use that to your advantage. </p>
<p>I also acknowledge that I&rsquo;m coming from an already busy and hectic life / business. Sometimes those extra hours are the most productive hours of my week (or at least the most fulfilling because I&rsquo;m creating for myself) and sometimes they&rsquo;re extra hard to create focused energy.</p>
<h3><b>2 &mdash; The &ldquo;second shift&rdquo; is <em>magic</em></b></h3><br />
 I saw  <a href="http://www.mirandajuly.com/"> Miranda July </a>  speak at <em>City Arts and Lectures</em> last year, and an audience member asked for advice about how to handle being a creative with a job, and what it meant to pull a second (or third) shift? I think this question was was implying after taking care of your personal life/family. Her response (which I pulled from  <a href="https://medium.com/@julievaughn/the-second-shift-artist-3579c753493f#.pqay2tcgw"> this article </a> ) was: </p>
<blockquote><p><i> &ldquo;Most humans are in some kind of bind, some kind of challenge. That&rsquo;s why we need art &hellip;and that&rsquo;s why we need to write and start in that place. It&rsquo;s also the rightful place from which the best art can come from.<strong> Embrace where you are and the struggle.</strong>" </i></blockquote><br />
 There will always be more to do, more creativity to pull out of yourself and sometimes that means it will be from 7pm-11pm (or 9pm-1am, or 5am-7am. You get it.) Be tired, let your adrenaline kick in and stay off Facebook.  </p>
<h3><b>3 &mdash; Perfection is the enemy of production </b></h3><br />
<i> &ldquo;If your fidelity to perfectionism is too high, you never do anything.&rdquo; &mdash; David Foster Wallace </i></p>
<p> I am telling you right now that if I wanted this article to be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t ever publish. I am also telling you that I have a full-time consulting practice, currently  <a href="http://bit.ly/AOworkshop"> writing and promoting a course </a> , have a large family that loves phone calls, friends I want to keep, a partner I like to spend time with AND I set aside the time to make this post a priority. All of this knowing that next week I will want to add a thought or word a sentence differently.  </p>
<p> So instead of focusing on what could be, I decided to win the game &hellip; Twice </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> First I set aside time to make this post a priority (and it was fulfilling and enlightening)  </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> The second was that I accepted that this article is perfect in its imperfect glory </li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"> Extra credit: I am meeting my goal of getting my name and thoughts in front of more people. &amp; like  <i> magic </i>  I&rsquo;m achieving forward motion and growth. </li><br />
</ul></p>
<h3><b>4 &mdash; Hire</b></h3><br />
 The copywriter, accountant, business consultant, or therapist you hire will be the best investment in your time and business&rsquo; growth.&nbsp;  The copywriter will ensure that you&rsquo;re meeting deadlines, your accountant will free up time, your business consultant will force you to take time out of the daily grind, and a therapist will make sure you&rsquo;re taking the moments to reflect and feel. &nbsp;These are just a few among many other wonderful people who can help you make more time to think and work on your goals. </p>
