<h6>I felt like I was an intern forever.</h6><br />
Every summer in college was another one I spent writing cover letters and going to interviews and passing out smiles and handshakes like they were free, because they were (sort of like my labor).</p>
<p>I interned with five different organizations before I graduated and got my first full time job in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought I&rsquo;d had enough of the whole being-a-student thing.</p>
<p><strong>Then I became a supervisor.</strong> All of a sudden, I was expected to know things. Like how to deal with crises and media inquiries and advertising agencies that won&rsquo;t stop calling. Like how to work the demon-possessed fax machine and where to find that check request form the Finance Department insists I use.</p>
<p>Even how to lead another person, who might even be older than me.</p>
<h6><em>No one prepared me for this.</em></h6><br />
I look at my current intern, and I remember what it was like when I was in her shoes only a few years ago, when my then-boss was content to give me only the busywork that seems in some ways to be a rite of passage.</p>
<p>And after stumbling through my first few supervising experiences, I&rsquo;ve realized if I&rsquo;m going to become the kind of teacher I wished I had, I&rsquo;m going to have to remember what it was like to be the student.</p>

" width="700" height="466" /></a>Here are a few points I use to remind me how to be a leader who can relate and empathize with those I&rsquo;m teaching:</h5></p>
<h6></h6><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<h6><strong>1. The <em>I-Don&rsquo;t-Know-BUT</em></strong></h6><br />
Confession: I&rsquo;m really good at convincing myself that I know everything until it&rsquo;s painfully obvious that I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When I was an intern, my favorite supervisors were the ones who not only asked to hear my ideas and opinions, but also genuinely cared about them. But when I became &ldquo;the boss,&rdquo; I began to realize how tempting it is to close myself off from other opinions.</p>
<p>A few days ago, my intern asked me a really good question about social media strategy. I&rsquo;ve lived practically half my life saturated in social media, so much so that it&rsquo;s now my full-time job, and I sat there thinking that I would like nothing better than to talk my way out of admitting that I didn&rsquo;t know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Instead I told her,</strong> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great question, and... I don&rsquo;t actually know. <em>But let&rsquo;s talk about it.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>In telling her &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know BUT...&rdquo; I wanted her to hear that I&rsquo;m on her team and she&rsquo;s on mine, and we can have conversations where she&rsquo;s empowered to contribute rather than be lectured.&nbsp;It's a great reminder that&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t and will never have all the answers. Shockingly enough, just because I&rsquo;m no longer an intern doesn&rsquo;t mean the learning stops.</p>
<h6><strong>2<em>. &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</em> Syndrome</strong></h6><br />
When it comes to taking on more responsibility, I&rsquo;ve never been good at saying no, even if it means I slowly break myself trying to do everything. Coincidentally (or not?), this is also a pattern I have noticed repeatedly in interns I&rsquo;ve supervised.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>If we say yes to everything, we will be known for nothing.<br />
-Jeff Shinabarger</em></blockquote><br />
Every time I become a yes-woman, I create another monster in my life that I can&rsquo;t slay because it only answers to a two-letter word that I never learned how to say.&nbsp;I should have learned it when I was an intern, but I thought it was expected of me to say yes to everything. That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re there for, right? To say yes, and do all the things? Yes, pilgrimage to Staples. Yes, I&rsquo;ll clean out the storage closet.&nbsp;<strong>When I said yes, I meant, <em>please remember me.</em></strong></p>
<p>Now I see interns bending over backwards trying to please everyone. <strong>The thing is, we shouldn&rsquo;t have to say yes to everything to be remembered.</strong> At this past year&rsquo;s Yellow Conference, Jeff Shinabarger (author of <em>Yes or No </em>and founder of <a href="http://www.plywoodpeople.com" target="_blank">Plywood People</a>) said, <em>&ldquo;If we say yes to everything, we will be known for nothing.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that I think interns should only do the projects that they want to do. Nobody has that luxury, and of course there are appropriate times and places for saying no.</p>
<p>I <em>am</em> saying that, as a supervisor, I&rsquo;m interested in what would happen <strong>if I respected their time as much as I guard my own. </strong>What if rather than asking them to prove themselves to me, I stood in their corner from the start&nbsp;What if I could show them how to appropriately say no by learning to say it myself?</p>
<h6><strong>3. Build the Room</strong></h6><br />
When I was an intern, the best supervisors I had were the ones who didn&rsquo;t just provide me with the space to do things in an unconventional way, but also <em>expected</em> me to think outside the box.</p>
<p>So maybe your company isn&rsquo;t used to letting interns take the lead. That&rsquo;s fine. But when you build the room for creativity, and let interns fill it with their wonderful, weird, wild ideas... you might just decide to live there for a while, too. And fill that space right along with them.&nbsp;<em>Build the room.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>When I was an intern, the best supervisors I had were the ones who didn&rsquo;t just provide me with the space to do things in an unconventional way, but also expected me to think outside the box.</em></blockquote><br />
 I once interned at a start-up creative agency that would pull the entire staff into a tiny room with four chairs, a table, and a sofa shoved into the corner, and we would sit practically on top of each other and wouldn&rsquo;t come out until every person had gotten the chance to share every half-decent idea in their head.&nbsp; Even the totally not-decent ideas got thrown around. No one was made fun of, and no one laughed at the interns when we said we wanted to play a worldwide game of telephone and film it.</p>

We wrote it on the whiteboard. We doodled rocket ships and film canisters and telegrams. And we&mdash;interns and supervisors together&mdash;tried to figure out how it would work...<br />
It didn&rsquo;t end up working. But it did lead to another idea, and another idea, and that idea became something great, and if we hadn&rsquo;t built the room, it might never have existed.</p>
<p><strong>Letting our experiences as interns, students, or employees can shape the way we lead and teach, if we let it. Learn from your experiences and grow from what you don&rsquo;t think worked, and glean from what you enjoyed most. </strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/214-800x598.jpg"><br />
