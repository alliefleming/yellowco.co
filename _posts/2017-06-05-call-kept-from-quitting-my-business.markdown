<h3><strong>As entrepreneurs, girlbosses, and creators, there&rsquo;s going to come a time where we want to quit.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Throw in the towel, kick up our feet with a glass of pinot, and say</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;"enough is enough!" </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve been in the I-want-to-quit stage more times than I can count. Most often, it&rsquo;s difficult to see past it. It feels suffocating and encapsulating and all you want to do is hide. Turn off the laptop, delete Instagram, reply &lsquo;no&rsquo; to every event, and just take a step back. But then, something will happen that brings it all back. <strong>The </strong></span><strong><i>why</i>, the essence&nbsp;of what you do. Why you&rsquo;re needed.</strong></p>
<p>Last year, I started down a path that didn&rsquo;t have an ending. A new path that I was forging on my own, without anyone to guide me. It was terrifying, liberating, awful, freeing, and one big beautiful mess all at once. I had hustled my behind off through the fall laying the groundwork for this new journey, business, and life. Then the holidays hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn&rsquo;t find the time to work on myself or my business, and everything kind of fell away. When the holiday rush was over, I didn&rsquo;t feel like going back to the hustle. I fell back onto the path previously&nbsp;laid out before me. The one that everyone expected me to be on. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was ready to call it quits altogether that I realized I&rsquo;d been hiding from success. Hiding from progress, hiding from more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the &lsquo;more&rsquo; is the hard part, right? Those first few steps of making it on your own can feel like</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;"Oh yeah I got this, I&rsquo;m awesome and totally know what I&rsquo;m doing"</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then a little further down the path there&rsquo;s a small hill you have climb. It may be tough, but you take it on, still on a new-beginning high. <strong>But ultimately, we can find ourselves in the thick of it, where the ground is rocky and all we can see is the steep uphill we have to endure.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&rsquo;s where I found myself. At the base of a cliff, looking up. Thinking there&rsquo;s no earthly way I can begin to chip away at all the things that need to happen in my business and life that will get me to where I want to be. This is the most tempting place to quit, or take the easy way out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about a week of staring at that cliff, a friend called me. She had&nbsp;a quiver in her voice and told me she&rsquo;s expecting her third baby. That it's a total surprise, and she doesn&rsquo;t know how she can possibly deal with this incredible change in her life. But then she said, <strong><em>"T</em></strong></span><strong><i>hank goodness for your blog and your community. I&rsquo;m going to need your encouragement now more than ever."</i></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tears filled my eyes as I tried to comfort her. I realized that this cliff I was about to start climbing would indeed&nbsp;be the hardest one yet, but I had my friend standing next to me to go through it. And another behind her, and another and another. But most importantly, I realized I&rsquo;m not doing this for me.</span></p>
<h3><strong>I climb these hills so that when I reach the top, I can look out and see how many lives I&rsquo;ve touched. How many mamas I&rsquo;ve encouraged, and how many of them have found each other as a result.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I dug around for the notebook I started when I first started this exciting adventure.&nbsp;I re-read my mission statement and the list of women I had written next to it asking to be a part&nbsp;of this community:</span></p>
<p><strong><em>"Connection with other mamas facing the bold questions of life balance. You are so welcome here."</em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took a rest, and brushed the dirt off.&nbsp;This journey is a constant one,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;but every step gets me a little closer to the top, and closer to fulfilling my mission. Because it&rsquo;s not time to quit, it&rsquo;s time to climb.</span></p>
