Blog: Building a sustainable lifestyle" width="700" height="467" /></a> We all want to see good win in the world. &nbsp;  But still, in 2016, it seems that everywhere we look, the underdog is struggling.  </h2></p>
<p class="p1"> I was twelve years old when my passion for freedom and justice was ignited. I was in my early twenties when I started working to end human trafficking and since then I have worked with amazing teams and phenomenal leaders, written action plans, aided public policy, created educational resources, managed prevention programs, spoken to audience filled arenas and participated in my fair share of marches, rallies, petitions and protests.  </p></p>
<p class="p1"> But something was missing.  </p></p>
<h2 class="p1"> Through it all, I&rsquo;ve learned that some efforts to end injustice create change while others simply create noise.  </h2></p>
<p class="p1"> If we want to get serious about ending major world issues like human trafficking, we need to build a sustainable movement. We need passionate, determined and resilient individuals who come with creative, effective, collaborative and holistic solutions that get to the root causes of rampant human exploitation.  </p></p>
<p class="p1"> Action plans and public policies are important but on their own, it will never be enough. We need you. We need the ones who are unwilling to give up, those who confront what&rsquo;s wrong and multiply what&rsquo;s right.   That&rsquo;s when things are really going to change. </p></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5842" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-10.jpg" alt="The Yellow Co. Blog: Building a sustainable lifestyle" width="700" height="467" /></a> <strong>It starts in small acts of everyday activism:</strong> buying fair trade or thrifted goods, shutting down degrading racist or sexist jokes that aren&rsquo;t funny, saying hello to the man on the sitting on the street corner and asking the barista, &ldquo;how was your day?&rdquo;  </p></p>
<p class="p1"> Every action we take, whether in a crowd or on our own, links up with and affects another human being. We change the world through our daily, intentional choices for freedom and justice&mdash;everyday activism that turns justice into a lifestyle. </p></p>
<h2 class="p1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-9-e1465936596937.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5841" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-9-e1465936596937.jpg" alt="The Yellow Co.

I&rsquo;ll never forget walking the coffee plantations of Guatemala and rolling tea hills of Sri Lanka, sifting coffee bean husks and plucking tea leaves with the ladies who are directly impacted by our choices to buy ethically sourced drinks.<strong> Direct trade makes a direct impact. </strong> </p></p>
<p class="p1"> <strong>Wear Makeup?</strong> Let&rsquo;s be real, most of us wear at least a little lipstick when going about our daily tasks at work, at home or even at the grocery store.

<p class="p1"> <strong><em>Walk</em> towards justice.</strong>&nbsp;I can&rsquo;t wait to sport my new <a href="https://ssekodesigns.com/footwear/sandals/ribbon-sandals.html?redirect_mongo_id=56d9c74a3830661735120300&amp;utm_campaign=Branded+Search&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=google&amp;gclid=CMiqupOtqM0CFYqPfgodsNkLcA" target="_blank">Sseko sandals</a> with gorgeous ribbons and interchangeable beaded accents to help send a girl in Uganda to college!

<p class="p1"> We can take our actions even further by living out our values through practical and hands-on acts of kindness. The world is much smaller than it ever used to be and every action we take affects another person, whether directly or indirectly. <strong>Live your activism through your words, how you spend your time and where you invest your resources.</strong> </p></p>
<h2 class="p1"> <strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5843" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/ValerieDenisePhotos-14.jpg" alt="The Yellow Co. Blog: Building a sustainable lifestyle" width="700" height="467" /></a></strong>  When we use our time, talents and resources for social good, we pursue justice as a lifestyle.  </h2></p>
<p class="p1"> Everyday activism is all about changing the world from where you are and living with intention through the things you do every day. It&rsquo;s about connecting the community; living local and thinking global so that we can bring justice and freedom to the people connected to the products we use and love every single day. </p></p>
