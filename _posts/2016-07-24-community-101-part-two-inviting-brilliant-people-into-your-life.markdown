Sunday Series: Community Building 101" width="700" height="1264" /></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second post in a new Sunday series by our Yellow Collective project manager </span></i><a href="http://www.laurencaselli.com/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Caselli</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about finding, creating, and growing a community of people who have your back. Whether it&rsquo;s online or in-person, free or paid, having a community of people who understand and support you can move you toward your goals faster than ever. To read the first&nbsp;post in this series, </span></i><b><i><a href="http://yellowconference.com/2016/07/10/community-101-a-new-series-about-making-friends-as-an-adult/" target="_blank">click here.</a><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1442.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6168" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1442.jpg" alt="Finding Your Squad: The Yellow Co.

<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/2016/07/10/community-101-a-new-series-about-making-friends-as-an-adult/" target="_blank">In this series' first post,</a> you&rsquo;ll remember that I mentioned making a list of the people that you want to be a part of your company&rsquo;s/life&rsquo;s steering committee. <em>A steering committee</em> is another word for an advisory board, but another way to think about it is to <em>choose the people that you would want to bounce ideas off of, and who would have a good perspective on issues you may be facing.</em></p>
<h2>So now that you have a list of amazing people that you&rsquo;d love to be in community with, here&rsquo;s what you should do next to actually get them in a room with you.</h2></p>
<h4><em><b>Decide if you prefer an in-person community or an online community. </b></em></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m a BIG fan of in-person communities, especially as an online entrepreneur, because I work at home and I live alone, and I&rsquo;m an extrovert.&nbsp;</span>Having a group of people that I can get together with once a month in-person, and then have supplementary, 1:1 meetings with throughout the month if I need more support, <em>is crucial to my own sanity.</em></p>
<p>Plus, expanding into a local market, getting to know other creatives in my town, and getting a lens on what other people are doing to make their businesses work locally is super important for my own marketing and growth efforts.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1495.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6170" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1495.jpg" alt="Finding Your Squad: The Yellow Co. Blog" width="700" height="1050" /></a>But maybe you like never having to exit your house and the thought of braving public transportation or after-work traffic gives you hives. Or, maybe just the thought of getting out of yoga pants is not in your business plan.&nbsp;<em>Plus,</em> you live in a rural community that doesn&rsquo;t have many people doing what you&rsquo;re doing OR you don&rsquo;t live in an epicenter of creativity and innovation, and want outside perspectives. A digital community with people from all over the world may be for you.</p>
<p>There are positives and negatives to both types of groups, but once you decide which you prefer, it&rsquo;s important that you as the organizer commit to being the driving force behind your gatherings.</p>
<h4><em><b>Choose about 5 - 6 people from your list that you know that </b><b>don&rsquo;t really know each other.</b></em></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways to actually get buy-in for a community is to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">specifically invite people with the promise that they&rsquo;ll meet other, vetted, equally-cool people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I always see on Facebook or in groups people saying <em>&ldquo;Anyone want to join a mastermind with me? Email for details!&rdquo;&nbsp;</em>That&rsquo;s not a great way of forming a strong community of supporters. You want an A-Team, and while some people that respond to a call like that may be on the A-Team, wouldn&rsquo;t it be better if you hand-picked your A-Team instead?</p>
<p><strong>Plus,</strong> you know what makes people jump on board to something even faster than you can invite them? A personalized invitation that says they&rsquo;ve been specifically chosen. AND that they will expand their contacts, since they won&rsquo;t really know anyone else in the group.</p>
<h4><em>Send them an email, detailing your goals and the outcomes you&rsquo;d like to achieve.</em></h4><br />
I even wrote you a script to make this easier! (P.S. Make sure you send these emails individually instead of in a blast format. It&rsquo;s always better to show a little TLC to people, and it will create even more goodwill and excitement around joining your community)...</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear <Name>,</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are you? I&rsquo;ve been watching your adventures on (Instagram/Facebook/in the local paper/your blog), and it seems like you&rsquo;ve been doing some amazing things! I&rsquo;m so impressed with you, and inspired by the awesome change you&rsquo;re making.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m emailing you because I admire the work you&rsquo;re doing in our community of (insert community here, either digital or in-person), and I&rsquo;d love for you to be a part of a group of creatives that I&rsquo;m forming.&nbsp;</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This group will be made up of a small group of other change-making creatives and we&rsquo;ll be meeting monthly to discuss (insert the discussion goals of your group).</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;d love for you to be a part of it because I think you have amazing (insert qualities that make this specific person a perfect fit), and we need a perspective like that in this group.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you&rsquo;re interested, please respond no later than (pick a date and time). Our first meeting will be XX, XX, 2016, where we&rsquo;ll get to know each other and talk about our expectations.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">So looking forward to having you as a part of this group!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best,<br />
</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><Your name></span></i></p>
<p><b>Note:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If only 3 people respond to this email, feel free to reach out to 2 or 3 more. I recommend a group of 6-7 to start with, as those groups are a great size for conversations that may require a &ldquo;tree of trust.&rdquo; Any bigger than 10, and it starts becoming difficult to have productive conversations where everyone gets a spotlight (don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll talk about growing your community in a future post, and deciding how to structure meetings/events/hangouts so that it speaks to everyone).</span></p>
<h4><em><b>What to do if someone says no or never responds:</b></em></h4><br />
Don&rsquo;t take it personally! We are all busy, and sometimes people need different communities at different times in their lives. However, I suspect, if you follow this model, not many people will say no (which is why I only recommend asking 5 -6 people to start with).<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1488.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6169" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1488.jpg" alt="Finding Your Squad: The Yellow Co.
