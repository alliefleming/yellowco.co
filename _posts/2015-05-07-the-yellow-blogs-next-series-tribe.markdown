<span style="line-height: 1.5;">And they have been since the moment we figured out<br />
</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">that we&rsquo;re sort of stuck with one another</span></p>
<p>We would have moments where we we&rsquo;re just so in love<br />
We would cuddle and tease<br />
Laugh and share ridiculous stories</p>
<p>And then we would have moments<br />
where my father would tell us to go put on our tae-kwon-doe uniforms<br />
and spar out our bickering</p>
<p>We never did,</p>
<p>but the foolishness of us fighting one another<br />
in all white uniforms and yellow belts,<br />
made us realize how silly our bickering really was</p>
<blockquote><p>We are called to be sisters,<br />
sharing traveling pants and exchanging vulnerability<br />
Be encouragers and sideline cheerleaders in races we should never have to run alone</blockquote><br />
I&rsquo;ve never been one of those women,<br />
who didn&rsquo;t get along with other women<br />
Maybe it was because of my three sisters<br />
or because guys, to this day, still freak me out<br />
Or maybe its because my mother is also my soul sister<br />
and so I&rsquo;ve always known, women keep me grounded;<br />
they are my lighthouses and my foundations</p>
<p>I met a friend once who told me upfront that she didn&rsquo;t like me</p>
<p>This then lead into conversations of how hurt she&rsquo;s been by women who did not see her value</p>
<p>She has carried these trust issues with her into every relationship</p>
<p>You see, we as women, have this tendency to compare our stories to each other like a horrible game of what&rsquo;s missing</p>
<p>We pick and pull at our lives wondering what&rsquo;s wrong with them when they don&rsquo;t match up to the perfect mom or housewife or party planner or the girl that everyone seems to want</p>
<p>We let comparison separate us instead of celebrating differences</p>
<p>I think, what we need is more people to tell us when to spar it out<br />
When to show us that we were never meant to tear down or fight</p>
<p>We are called to live in harmony with one another<br />
And lift each other up,<br />
We are called to be sisters,<br />
sharing traveling pants and exchanging vulnerability<br />
Be encouragers and sideline cheerleaders in races we should never have to run alone</p>
<p>We need someone to tell us sometimes,<br />
<em>You&rsquo;re not a horrible mother, or daughter or sister or student</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re a frazzled hot mess right now</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have it all together</p>
<p>Imagine what life would be like,<br />
if we knew the power of change tucked into each of our frames<br />
Because I don&rsquo;t know if you know this&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>but women are pretty freaking awesome</strong></p>
<p>We are family pillars and open windows, we are life givers and hard lovers<br />
We are strong, eclectic masterpieces of so many stories</p>
<p>We are Rory and Loreli</p>
<p>And Ruth and Naomi</p>
<p><em>Where you lead I will follow<br />
</em><em>Anywhere, that you tell me to<br />
</em><em>If you need, if you need me to be with you<br />
</em><em>I will follow,<br />
</em><em>Where you lead</em></p>
<blockquote><p>We need someone to tell us sometimes,<br />
<em>You&rsquo;re not a horrible mother, or daughter or sister or student<br />
</em>It&rsquo;s okay if you&rsquo;re a frazzled hot mess right now</blockquote><br />
We are the hospital hands when uncertainty knocks<br />
And casseroles on door steps<br />
We were never supposed to do this alone<br />
We were always meant to guide the other home,<br />
leave the light on when it takes a little while</p>
<p>Maybe if we promised to do better, to extend more patience<br />
So i&rsquo;ll start</p>
<p>I promise to be the one who lies next to you when you&rsquo;re convinced everything in this world is against you</p>
<p>I will volunteer as tribute whenever your name is placed in raffle for a dangerous game</p>
<p>I will fight, just for you</p>
<p>I will hurt just for you</p>
<p>Remind you of your strength in the moments you are weak</p>
<p>And to be the one who sows your cape when it&rsquo;s tattered</p>
<p>I will pray and love you, unconditionally</p>
<p>And I will leave the light on, as long as you need</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll always have a home here,<br />
Please know that&hellip;.you&rsquo;ll always have a home here</p>
