[![The Yellow Blog: Tribe Series](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/04/2014-09-03_0042.jpg)](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/04/2014-09-03_0042.jpg)My sisters are my best friends  
And they have been since the moment we figured out  
that we’re sort of stuck with one another

We would have moments where we we’re just so in love  
We would cuddle and tease  
Laugh and share ridiculous stories

And then we would have moments  
where my father would tell us to go put on our tae-kwon-doe uniforms  
and spar out our bickering

We never did,

but the foolishness of us fighting one another  
in all white uniforms and yellow belts,  
made us realize how silly our bickering really was

> We are called to be sisters,  
> sharing traveling pants and exchanging vulnerability  
> Be encouragers and sideline cheerleaders in races we should never have to run alone

I’ve never been one of those women,  
who didn’t get along with other women  
Maybe it was because of my three sisters  
or because guys, to this day, still freak me out  
Or maybe its because my mother is also my soul sister  
and so I’ve always known, women keep me grounded;  
they are my lighthouses and my foundations

I met a friend once who told me upfront that she didn’t like me

This then lead into conversations of how hurt she’s been by women who did not see her value

She has carried these trust issues with her into every relationship

You see, we as women, have this tendency to compare our stories to each other like a horrible game of what’s missing

We pick and pull at our lives wondering what’s wrong with them when they don’t match up to the perfect mom or housewife or party planner or the girl that everyone seems to want

We let comparison separate us instead of celebrating differences

I think, what we need is more people to tell us when to spar it out  
When to show us that we were never meant to tear down or fight

We are called to live in harmony with one another  
And lift each other up,  
We are called to be sisters,  
sharing traveling pants and exchanging vulnerability  
Be encouragers and sideline cheerleaders in races we should never have to run alone

We need someone to tell us sometimes,  
_You’re not a horrible mother, or daughter or sister or student_

It’s okay if you’re a frazzled hot mess right now

You don’t have to have it all together

Imagine what life would be like,  
if we knew the power of change tucked into each of our frames  
Because I don’t know if you know this…

**but women are pretty freaking awesome**

We are family pillars and open windows, we are life givers and hard lovers  
We are strong, eclectic masterpieces of so many stories

We are Rory and Loreli

And Ruth and Naomi

_Where you lead I will follow  
__Anywhere, that you tell me to  
__If you need, if you need me to be with you  
__I will follow,  
__Where you lead_

> We need someone to tell us sometimes,  
> _You’re not a horrible mother, or daughter or sister or student  
> _It’s okay if you’re a frazzled hot mess right now

We are the hospital hands when uncertainty knocks  
And casseroles on door steps  
We were never supposed to do this alone  
We were always meant to guide the other home,  
leave the light on when it takes a little while

Maybe if we promised to do better, to extend more patience  
So i’ll start

I promise to be the one who lies next to you when you’re convinced everything in this world is against you

I will volunteer as tribute whenever your name is placed in raffle for a dangerous game

I will fight, just for you

I will hurt just for you

Remind you of your strength in the moments you are weak

And to be the one who sows your cape when it’s tattered

I will pray and love you, unconditionally

And I will leave the light on, as long as you need

You’ll always have a home here,  
Please know that….you’ll always have a home here
