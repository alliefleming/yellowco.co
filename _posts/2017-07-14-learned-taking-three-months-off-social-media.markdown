<p>Right now is the best time to have a heartbeat. Opportunities are directly in front of us if we ask and act for them. Our generation is booming with believers in creating the extraordinary - in every capacity from relationships to careers. Social media has become a tool to foster this connection, creativity, and growth, yet it's also a means of comparison, shame, and unhealthy addiction.</p>
<p>Stuck somewhere in between these polarities, I had to ask myself: <strong><em>how can I create a&nbsp;sweet spot of using social media for all of its&nbsp;benefits, while staying clear of unhealthy, unproductive patterns?</em></strong> To find the answer, I gave up Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for three months. I learned truths that have already sprung me forward into the next season. I became focused and clear. In the tension from start to finish, I learned three main principles about my relationship to social media:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Comparison is a choice. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a habit, state of mind, and something&nbsp;I am in control of changing. I was the queen of comparison. Initially I used social media as a means for inspiration toward a better self. But in the process, it became an excuse to doubt my own ability to achieve a goal simply because someone had already reached it. For example,&nbsp;my summer goals revolved around physical fitness and finances. This is how comparison manifested in them with social media in their presence:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fitness: Create workout routine.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at Alexia Clark&rsquo;s Instagram page for inspiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempt to do 10 pull ups.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accomplish zero pull ups because I have trained for them zero times.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drink coffee and read about getting fit, but not actually work out.</span></p>
<p>Finances: Create budget.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">See Tony Robbins in his private jet on Instagram. Become b</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ummed that I don&rsquo;t have three houses and one billion dollars.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy a $5 latte and read about becoming wealthy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one is surprised that I got very little accomplished with these habits. <strong>I was the poster child for knowledge without action, and comparison of those who took action.</strong> It was a recipe for disaster. But even without social media, I found ways to compare myself to others who I thought lived a better lifestyle than me, simply because I was looking at their pretty, cropped lives from the outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that life isn&rsquo;t filtered. But it&rsquo;s the daily, unfiltered choices that&nbsp;move us&nbsp;toward huge change. Your journey is <em>your</em> journey, and that is a&nbsp;strength! Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to someone else&rsquo;s finished product. Choose a new thought pattern.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Social media is a&nbsp;crutch for procrastination.</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bored? Check Instagram. Not sure where to take this project? Scroll through updates. I wanted more in my life, but &ldquo;more&rdquo; was an elusive destination I was unsure how to accomplish. It was easy to bury myself in my phone when I was stuck on&nbsp;how to start writing a piece, afraid to email editors with ideas, or even confused how&nbsp;to start planning a great workout routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking the option of checking social media off the table allowed me the space to figure out what daily choices would move me forward in my long-term goals. &ldquo;More&rdquo; is now a concrete destination that I actively work toward daily. It&rsquo;s pretty crazy what happens when we allow ourselves permission to get clear on what we want. <strong>For me, the comfortable convenience of social media was the roadblock that stood in my way.</strong> To eliminate this pillar of safety meant I now had to put pressure on new muscles: productivity!<br />
</span></p>

<h3><strong>3. False standards get us nowhere.&nbsp;</strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">I broke up with the idea that life </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> look and feel a certain way all the time. From the feeds of&nbsp;entrepreneurs, to bloggers, to stylists, it&rsquo;s easy to create standards for ourselves based on what we see and look up to. Here&rsquo;s the problem with that process: life is like a movie. We are the director, and our followers are the critics. They see the finished product, but we see the raw footage. Just like the cinemas, there&rsquo;s a reason that every scene doesn&rsquo;t make the cut &ndash; they&rsquo;re not all pretty!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I once got fired from a retail job because I switched my schedule around and wasn&rsquo;t there to open the store. Instagram never saw a post from me that read, &ldquo;got fired today lol&rdquo;. &nbsp;At the time, it was definitely not an &ldquo;lol&rdquo; moment. It sucked. I ugly cried and felt shame all over my body. <strong>But it&rsquo;s to my benefit today because I learned that real life experiences would shape me far better than the filtered ones I see online. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comparison, procrastination, and the false belief that life should be playing out differently are all universal experiences. Without the vice of social media, I was able to see their prevalent influence in my own life, stay present on my own journey, and choose daily, healthy habits to move myself toward my goals. I created a budget that allows for great coffee and giving to organizations I&rsquo;m passionate about. I developed a workout routine and meal plan that give me energy and require discipline. Overall, I'm confident that I won&rsquo;t be wasting valuable time by mindlessly spending hours on social media. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone has vices. They are teachers that create healthy pressures and&nbsp;show us where we can grow. I encourage you to get clear on what yours are, try fasting them for a period of time, and let the tension of their absence create wonders in your story!</span></p>
