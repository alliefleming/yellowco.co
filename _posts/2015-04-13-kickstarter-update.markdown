Dear Reader,

Ok, so [this Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c) is moving steady, but it's really not steady enough. Honestly at this point it's going to take EVERY blog reader (that means you!) to get on board and donate to make this happen. If each of you donate just $5, we will be well on our way to making this goal happen.

I TRULY believe in the power of this website. I believe in a place where women can come and learn the ins and outs of how to start their own businesses. A place where women who are feeling alone, needing direction can come to for inspiration. A place where women who are seeking connection with like-minded women can meet.

I know it's a difficult thing to visualize a place like this, as it hasn't been created yet, but I'm asking you to trust. Trust that what we are going to create something powerful. The Yellow Conference last year was a huge success, and we know we can create something equally empowering in the digital realm. But we can not do it ourselves.

We have a long road to go, with so little time. The ONLY way this can happen is with your help. There is power in numbers.

Even just a $5 donation is worth it. If you believe in us and trust in this dream, I'm asking you to join us and back this project. So skip that latte today and back this project. We can't do it without you. (literally!)

Thank you so much for your support, it means the world!
