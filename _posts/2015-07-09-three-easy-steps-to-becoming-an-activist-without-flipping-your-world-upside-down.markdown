    This piece spoke to my heart and soul - I'm a very-just-graduate (albeit a mature one - I'm 29) who is in a state of limbo-and-flail; I worked on-and-off for 10 years before uni and worked many-a-job that I found not to suit. And then...education didn't suit (which is a long story I won't go into here!), which means I'm currently overwhelmed and trying to figure it all out, although I have come to the conclusion that I want to make a difference, no matter how small, to others, their lives, or this planet as a whole. What I have are my words - something I pour my heart and soul into, and spill onto the page with an honest-to-goodness, this-is-me-as-and-where-I-am voice - and anything I can do to make writing a part of my future I will. And I love where Avery said her heart identified with what it does because yes, yes, YES - I am all about community building and connection via social media, and supporting all those I share that space with because, my goodness, do they light up my life!


    Thank you so much for sharing this piece here, Avery. I'm so blown away.

<p>In my two years since graduating college, I have held about seven different jobs. I began working in the startup industry originally before shifting roles to try my hand at freelancing, a brief stint at nannying to make ends meet, and even instructing indoor cycling classes.</p>
<p>There were many days I would come back home at the end of the day utterly depleted, unable to do much more than lift a fork full of takeout into my mouth before going to bed ridiculously early or drowning in Netflix marathons. While I learned a lot about myself during my time at each of these positions, I just knew <em>something</em> was missing.</p>
<p><strong>It was during this time of bouncing from role to role I began to realize in order to feel fulfilled in my work, I needed to reexamine my own goals: instead of working for a paycheck, a day off, or the weekend, I needed to figure out a way to use my gifts to work for the good of others in order to feel whole myself.</strong></p>
<p>I began to channel this creative energy and inspiration into my work endeavors as well as brainstorming passion projects outside of the workspace. When I started finding and creating opportunities to bring my talents to my work whether or not they fit my job title, I found not only was I happier, my job performance got a boost as well. <strong>It was the purpose behind my role and those I was helping along the way that led me to feel more complete.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">It was during this time of bouncing from role to role I began to realize in order to feel fulfilled in my work, I needed to reexamine my own goals: instead of working for a paycheck, a day off, or the weekend, I needed to figure out a way to use my gifts to work for the good of others in order to feel whole myself.</span></em></blockquote><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">So how can you find a space to do good with your talents? If you&rsquo;re seeking a way to live with purpose and spread goodness, ask yourself these three questions to find your starting point:</span></p>
<p><strong>Where is the need?</strong></p>
<p>Once you have taken a good long look at your skill set, it is time to find the space you can use them to make an impact.&nbsp;Start by looking at what is right around you: your workplace, your friendships, and your town. Is there a large homeless population requiring your conversational skills- or simply just your bomb peanut butter jelly sandwich making talents? What about a blank, whitewashed wall begging for your art? A patch of soil for a community garden brought to life by your green thumb? A public tax clinic you can shine by crunching numbers with your beautiful brain?</p>
<p>The need could even be in your workplace. Organize lunches or happy hours with your office mates to encourage communication, or infuse your daily tasks with kindness and treat others with respect. These are all small ways to serve others and do good without making a huge transition.</p>
<p>I found need in my relationships. While connecting with old friends and classmates, and even when meeting new people, I sensed this veil shrouding our conversations. It seemed as though there was an unspoken need to appear to have it all together: the job, the significant other, the money. Instead of sharing our struggles, highs and lows with others, we had to hide behind a wall of perfection.&nbsp;That was the area of need I wanted to tap into, the brokenness I wanted to heal. What will yours be?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Our gifts of creativity come in many different packages. Open yours and share it with others.</em></blockquote><br />
<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">What are you good at?</strong></p>
<p>An avid writer and blogger, I wanted to tackle the need I saw in the only way I knew how: through writing.</p>
<p>It was at <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/yellow-conference-2015" target="_blank">Yellow Conference</a> last year I struck up conversation with Sarah, a newly made friend for the weekend. Together we shared our desire to start something new, building an online community to bust through perfection with authenticity in our relationships and mindfulness in our days. And so, <a href="http://foundedmagazine.com/" target="_blank">Founded Magazine</a> was born.</p>
<p>When examining your own gifts, it is important to remember you don&rsquo;t have to be a writer or an artist to be &ldquo;creative&rdquo;. Maybe you are great with numbers and analytics, born to be a lawyer or a natural at learning new languages. <strong>Our gifts of creativity come in many different packages. </strong>Open yours and share it with others.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love?</strong></p>
<p>For me, my heart identified with young women like myself struggling with discovering their identity after college. I also loved writing, social media and being a part of an online conversation, and helping others discover their light. Working with Founded Magazine allows me to bundle all of these loves together into one online space.</p>
<p>What makes your heart beat? Is it children? Animals? A foreign country? Those struggling with loss or addiction? Seek out a cause you can identify with, one in need of your unique set of skills. True creativity is tailoring your gifts to serve those that make your heart race and head spin.</p>
<p>Whether you are creating something new as a side hustle, or simply finding your creative way to make an impact in your current workplace, remember you are capable of making a difference.</p>
<p>All it takes is some thought and heart to start changing the world. Be the spark to start the fire.</p>
