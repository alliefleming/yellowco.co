<p>With the <a href="http://yellowco.co/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 Yellow Conference</a> only a few short months away, we wanted you to start getting to know this year's incredible speakers a bit better! First up is <a href="http://www.gungormusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lisa Gungor</a>, Grammy-nominated musician and artist, mother of two girls, and all around inspiring storyteller.</p>
<h4><b>Tell us the story of starting Gungor, and what sparked you to create music.</b></h4><br />
 LG: It is always a little difficult for me to decipher just where the spark started. I used to sit for hours in this huge overstuffed orange chair and listen to my Dad&rsquo;s records, immediately lost in music - so that was a definite spark. I remember the day I wrote my first poem - &nbsp;I sat high in the branches of the maple tree in my front yard, my usual spot for daydreaming or pretending. After writing that poem in the tree, I went to the piano I didn&rsquo;t yet know how to play, and found a melody for it.  </p>
<h3><strong>That&rsquo;s how writing songs started for me - it didn&rsquo;t feel like something I decided to do, more something that found its way to me, like art often does.</strong></h3><br />
 There was just something about arranging words in an artful way, carefully crafting each line, that was so intriguing. I would read every line on the insert of a record or CD while it played. Listening to music wasn&rsquo;t passive, I was always fully engaged. I still remember that first song, but it is definitely one of those that only your Mom would say is great out of total Mom guilt (or blind Mother love) - so it will not be appearing on any albums anytime soon or ever. </p>
<p> A long time later I met my husband, Michael, by an old pay phone at the university we were attending. He was a musician and one grand evening we showed each other all of the songs we had written in a tiny little practice room. I sat at the piano, he sat on the floor. It was never the plan to write music together, we wrote pretty differently - in both theme and composition. </p>

<p> When we first tried to write together it crashed and burned. Crafting a piece of art with another person is a vulnerable thing. Thus, feelings can get hurt oh so easily when co-writing. It requires being un-attached to your ideas a lot. But eventually, we found ourselves writing together in a natural way. Like so many musicians, we both grew up playing music in church, and that is where our music started. Later we began getting&nbsp;invited to play in various venues, so we thought we should probably have an actual band to play with. Everything really took a turn though when we began writing from a deeper place - unafraid of speaking to deep pain or belief. </p>
<h4><b>What times of transition in your life have proved most important to get you where you are now?</b></h4><br />
 LG: The hardest transitional time of my life was 2014 - I had an existential crisis (always fun), and in the middle of that year had a beautiful, squishy baby girl. At her birth we were given a grim diagnosis for her life. She faced two heart surgeries, and we weren&rsquo;t sure if she would live, or what her life would look like if she did. I never imagined how hard that would be. It&rsquo;s one of those things you think always happens to someone else, not you. </p>
<p> Honestly, it turned out more beautiful than I thought it could be. I feel pretty lucky to have gone through the transition of thinking I knew what a good life meant, and now knowing what it really means. Yeah, it&rsquo;s still super hard at times, but what life isn&rsquo;t?&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Without this struggle, I think I would have a thin philosophy on life - a dreamed up one instead of a flesh and blood one.</h3><br />
I definitely don&rsquo;t claim to have arrived by any means, but I think there is something that suffering and pain has unearthed in me.</p>

<h4><b>What has been your greatest struggle as&nbsp;a musician and artist?</b></h4><br />
 LG: Staying true to the art. It is often tempting to go the easy route for money and safeness sake. Especially with having two kids, I want their life to be secure, but then I remember security isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m after. </p>
<h3><strong>Security is never a great springboard for good art. Risk is.</strong></h3><br />
 In every career you can get caught up in comparison. You see others who shoot to the top of the success ladder so fast, and it is tempting to&nbsp;compare. Staying true to the art I know I am supposed to make during&nbsp;really difficult times is a practice. </p>
<h4><b>Who has impacted your life in a profound way?</b></h4><br />
LG: Oh so many. The top of the list are my girls - this may sound like the quintessential Mom phrase, but it&rsquo;s so true. My girls have opened up my life in a way I didn&rsquo;t know children could. They are my teachers and my late-night dance party partners - everyone needs that. Others are: Mary Oliver, Allan Watts, Ram Dass, Hafiz, Anthony DeMello, Shane Claiborne, and Richard Rohr.</p>
<h4><b>The theme of this year&rsquo;s conference is <em>The Present Journey</em>. How we must embrace the process instead of only focusing on the finish line.&nbsp;</b><b>How does this tension of being present, while looking to the future, resonate with you?</b></h4><br />
 LG: The present is all there is. That could be the theme of this year for me. We Westerners don&rsquo;t do &ldquo;present&rdquo; as well as the Easterners (blanket statement here, yes). I think our idea of success has a lot to do with that, because our idea of measuring up keeps us looking to the future. </p>
