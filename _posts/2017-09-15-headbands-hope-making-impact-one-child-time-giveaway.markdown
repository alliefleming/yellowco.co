<p><em>It is easy to sometimes feel helpless in the face of something out of our control - but we should never underestimate&nbsp;the impact that can be made even in a small action. Jess Ekstrom, founder of <a href="https://www.headbandsofhope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Headbands of Hope</a>,&nbsp;shared her story with us of this reality.&nbsp;For every headband they sell, one is given to a girl with cancer. In honor of childhood cancer awareness month, we have also partnered with them on a GIVEAWAY! <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZEHS-0hE5I/?taken-by=headbandsofhope" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See how to enter here for a Headbands of Hope subscription box and 1 month free of a Yellow Collective membership!</a>&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
I never thought of myself as an entrepreneur. Growing up, I always wanted to be a journalist or work for a magazine. But then one summer in college, I interned at a wish-granting organization for kids with life-threatening illnesses. A lot of them would lose their hair during chemotherapy and they&rsquo;d be offered a wig or a hat. However, a lot of the kids I saw loved to wear headbands instead of covering up their heads. I started to research organizations that give headbands to kids with cancer and couldn&rsquo;t find any.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment (unknowingly) I became an entrepreneur because I wanted to solve this problem. I didn&rsquo;t really think about all of the hardships that come with starting a business and everything that could go wrong. I just knew that a lot of these kids wanted to wear headbands and no one was recognizing that, or even if they were, no one was doing anything about it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of my junior year in April 2012, I launched <a href="https://www.headbandsofhope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Headbands of Hope</a>. For every headband sold, one is given to a child with cancer. Today, we&rsquo;re carried in over 2,000 stores (including ULTA locations!) and we&rsquo;ve been on the TODAY Show, Good Morning America, The View, Vanity Fair, Women&rsquo;s Health, People Magazine, and I get to travel to speak all around the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my biggest accomplishment is donating headbands to every children&rsquo;s hospital in the United States.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some moments, I&rsquo;m euphoric with this movement I&rsquo;ve created and the impact that it&rsquo;s had on so many kids. But other moments (too many that I&rsquo;d like to admit) I feel an anxiousness that I&rsquo;m not doing enough, or that I could be doing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">more</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h3><strong>I think when you&rsquo;re trying to make a change and do something big, it&rsquo;s hard to ever be truly satisfied with where you&rsquo;re at because there&rsquo;s always more that could be done. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, I met an astronaut (pretty cool!) and he said no matter how great of a career he&rsquo;ll have as an astronaut, he&rsquo;ll never truly make a dent on the galaxy. On the outside, I thought just being an astronaut is a huge accomplishment in and of itself. But to him, he sees not what he&rsquo;s done</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">but what&rsquo;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">left to be done</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I realized, even though him and I live in totally different worlds (pun intended), we&rsquo;re both struggling with the same tension of never being satisfied. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On one hand, I credit a lot of the success of my career to the mentality that I can always be doing more, because it&rsquo;s fueled a lot of my hustle. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s robbed me of a lot of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the process. And if I can&rsquo;t enjoy the life I&rsquo;ve created, that&rsquo;s a big problem to me. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9531" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/0T6A0437.jpg" alt="HEADBANDS OF HOPE: MAKING AN IMPACT ONE CHILD AT A TIME (&amp; A GIVEAWAY!) - THE YELLOW ROOM" width="5760" height="3840" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found a lot of this anxiety stemmed from comparison. When you&rsquo;re trying to do something big, you meet a lot of other people trying to create something cool too. I&rsquo;ve loved being a part of a growing community of entrepreneurs, activists, and people who are going for it; but it&rsquo;s so easy to hold a ruler between yourself and someone else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ll start to compare what I&rsquo;m doing with what they&rsquo;re doing and start to doubt myself. It&rsquo;s embarrassing to admit that, because on the inside, I truly want more people to take action, start businesses, and hold a level of responsibility for the world&rsquo;s issues and inspire solutions. But then there&rsquo;s this insecurity that creeps in and makes you think you&rsquo;re not measuring up to everyone else trying to make an impact.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Those moments when I&rsquo;m comparing myself give me no room for creativity or innovation. </strong></h3><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">My mind is too cluttered with doubt that I have nothing else to give to my business or even my relationships. I learned a lot from a story Chelsea Handler told about a friend she invited to her comedy group. Her friend got picked up by a talent scout before Chelsea did. At first, she was jealous and angry. But then she learned from her sister that someone else&rsquo;s success is not robbing you of your own.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Sometimes it may seem that success is just a small platform that only a few people can fit on, but there&rsquo;s room for everyone at the top. </strong></h3><br />
And if that&rsquo;s the case, we might as well cheer each other on as we all try to make it.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the outside, it seems the bigger <a href="https://www.headbandsofhope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Headbands of Hope</a> gets, the more successful I should feel. But really the more it develops, it presents more opportunity for me to develop with it. Each day I get closer to finding a balance of hustle for where I want to be, and happiness for where I&rsquo;m at now.</span></p>
