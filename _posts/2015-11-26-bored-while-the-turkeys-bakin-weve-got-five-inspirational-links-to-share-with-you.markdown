##### Happy Thanksgiving from the Yellow Co.!

While you're waiting for that turkey to finish cooking, we thought we'd share some of our favorite blogs and sites to keep you busy and inspired!

1. ###### [The Created Co. ](http://thecreated.co/blogs/news)

   [![Yellow Conference Blog](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/IMG_5353.jpg)](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/IMG_5353.jpg)Rumor has it the Created Co. is going to have a stellar Black Friday sale. Remember their mugs at the Yellow Conference this year? They also have some delicious fall recipes like Pumpkin Spice Lattes and Apple Cider...what would make Thanksgiving that much better? Apple Cider, of course!

2. ###### Johanna Tropiano's [Conscious Closets Blog](http://www.consciousclosets.co/)

   From Coco Chanel inspiration to lingerie, this gal is our go-to for information on ways to keep our spending ethical. Her new blog consists of different inspirational shoots, information on sustainable and ethical brands, and [interviews with people like Blythe Hill, the founder of Dressember.](http://www.consciousclosets.co/blog/2015/10/27/conscious-closets-and-blythe-hill) December is just around the corner! This could be your perfect read as those candied yams are just melting to perfection.

3. ###### Aren't sure what to do with that Black Friday cash? Maybe consider helping fund [this family's adoption](http://www.melinda-ann.com/search/label/Our%20House) instead...

   [![fam pic new background-002 copy](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/fam-pic-new-background-002-copy.jpg)](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/fam-pic-new-background-002-copy.jpg)This woman's blog shares about her family's journey to adopting the cutest kid in the world (the pictures are honestly reason enough to check them out). Now they're in the process of adopting baby number **TWO!**

4. ######  Read [Ruthie Lindsey's](http://www.ruthielindsey.com/hello/) inspiring story of healing and gratitude. [![Ruthie-Headshot](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/Ruthie-Headshot.jpg)](https://yellow-blog-images.imgix.net/2015/11/Ruthie-Headshot.jpg)

5. ###### Check out [this app](http://www.1secondeveryday.com/)...

   1 Second Everyday literally makes a movie of one-second moments captured from your phone. What a great way to remember those small moments that knit the beauty of our lives together *(and here's a [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/19/414973612/can-you-remember-your-life-one-second-at-a-time) by the designer of it). *

There you have it! Perfect pair to pumpkin pie and Good Earth Tea...However you are celebrating this holiday, we hope you are finding the magic in the small things, and small moments to say thanks...and maybe even curl up with a good book and a cozy knit blanket.

xoxo
