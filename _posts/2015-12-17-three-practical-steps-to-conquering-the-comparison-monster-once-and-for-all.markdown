[![the yellow co. blog: i fought the comparison monster, and WON....here's how.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2015/12/5-800x533.jpg)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/yellow-files/blog/2015/12/5-800x533.jpg)In a world where we are constantly inundated with messages from social media and other outlets, sometimes it’s hard to find the truth about who we are and what it is we are supposed to do with this one amazing life we’ve been given.

## We compare. We hold back. We copy and ultimately trick ourselves, many times, into thinking that what we are doing is being true to ourselves, when in reality, we couldn’t be further from authenticity.

> _What I find most challenging is that when I begin to compare myself to others, I push myself further and further away from the heart and message I intended to communicate in the first place. After the 100<sup>th</sup> scroll of the day on Instagram or the billionth hashtag on Twitter, it can sometimes to be hard to pull ourselves out of the messages, voices, truths and opinions of others._

It’s taken me years to finally find my voice (and to be honest, some days are still quite the struggle) and figure out what‘s most important to me when it comes to putting my work, my words and my talents out there for all to see.

What I find most challenging is that when I begin to compare myself to others, I push myself further and further away from the heart and message I intended to communicate in the first place. After the 100<sup>th</sup> scroll of the day on Instagram or the billionth hashtag on Twitter, it can sometimes to be hard to pull ourselves out of the messages, voices, truths and opinions of others.

## So, how do we practice strengthening our own voices and conquer the ‘comparison monster’ once and for all?

#### **Believe you’ve got something to say.**

The truth is, it takes more than passion to build a business and promote a brand. But that’s not really what all this is about, is it? Believe that your story, your time and your gifts matter. Why? Well, because they really do, of course. When you are sharing what you love in order to bring inspiration to others, those who read your message or follow your platform will sense that. You then become more relatable and real and this is what encourages others to stick around and even return. Your messages matters.

#### **Silence the naysayers.**

In your head, that is. And sometimes, this starts with your own voice. This bit has everything to do with you and how you choose to allow what others may believe or say about you, affect you. This charge is less external and more of an internal control of emotional and physical stability. In order to continue on the path to what you deem as success, you must first understand and establish that your message and your brand may not ‘be for everyone’ and that is okay.

#### **Don’t trade your authenticity for approval.**

Embrace who you are. Trust your journey and listen to the voice inside that continues to push you in the direction of your dreams, passions and visions. No one ever grew or strengthened their own lives by only listening to the direction or voice of others. Trust that what you have to offer is just what someone (or many) out there.

_**“I’d rather be honest and authentic and disappoint some people, than to exhaust myself trying to keep up the façade of perfection.” –Crystal Paine.**_

Let’s challenge ourselves to ‘keep it real’ and connect in a new authentic way. In that, there is great reward.
