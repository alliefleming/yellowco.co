How you present yourself on social media, in your daily lives, and how others perceive you is all part of this ‘brand.’

When Yellow introduced this seasons series, _**Refine**_, I was instantly inspired. The definition of ‘Refine’ as a verb is to become elegant, but it is also to purify. As we enter a new season, purifying the mind and re-centering who each of us are as individuals, and as a collective in our companies/workplaces is so important to making sure that we are aligning with our true selves and values.
