<p>Yes, you read that title right. Today is a special day where we get to "officially" announce... Yellow Collective memberships open back up NEXT WEDNESDAY, March 15th (also the same day the new Beauty and the Beast comes out - #bestdayever)! That's right!&nbsp;Get excited ladies.</p>
<p>We open up the membership once a quarter and keep it open for 2 weeks. Once a quarter is only 4 times a year...&nbsp;so this is kind of a big deal.<a href="http://eepurl.com/bEZbaH" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-8162 size-full" src="http://yellowco.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Membership.jpg" width="700" height="500" /></a></p>
