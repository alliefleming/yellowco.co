<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><em><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1488.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5597" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1488.jpg" alt="_MG_1488" width="700" height="1050" /></a>As a creative, I usually have a lot of irons in the fire...and I'm sure you do too.</em> </span></h2></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Right now I&rsquo;m in the middle of directing my second feature documentary, developing a new short series, writing a folk musical and preparing to lead a women&rsquo;s lifestyle retreat. One of my greatest strengths as an artist has been my adaptability. Over the years, it has served my craft but at the start of&nbsp;2016 I wanted to take my work to the next level. I wanted to create with more quality and intention, finally giving time to those dream projects sacrificed at the altar of adaptability. </span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&rsquo;ve always cringed at the thought of setting schedules and writing to-do lists. I&rsquo;ve viewed them as confining to my creativity. But, at the beginning of this year I read an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/google-time-management_us_5671f55de4b0dfd4bcc0969f"><span class="s2">article</span></a> on the Huffington Post (I highly recommend reading it!) written by google employee, Jeremiah Dillon, who broke down the work week for <em>&ldquo;Makers.&rdquo;</em> I was so inspired by this article I sent it out to all my freelance friends and actually put it into practice. The main point of the article is that <strong>as Makers we have to protect blocks of time to create</strong>. We can&rsquo;t just squeeze 30 minutes out of a day packed with meetings and expect to make magic. No one will protect your creative space if you don&rsquo;t protect it first. </span></p></p>
<h2 class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1412.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5595" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1412.jpg" alt="_MG_1412" width="700" height="1050" /></a>Here&rsquo;s how this daily distracted, often reactive, creative has managed to let the work week work for me. </span></h2></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Identify your &ldquo;Creative Buckets&rdquo;</i></span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I started by categorizing all of my creative endeavors into 5 buckets. It&rsquo;s ok if you have more, you&rsquo;ll just need to split your days accordingly. Mine are Feature Films, Short Films, Commercial Work, Education and Art for Art (this one is for all of the fun things I&rsquo;m a part of that don&rsquo;t have to do with my main craft of filmmaking). In each bucket I wrote out all of the projects that fell under those categories. Next, I wrote out my long and short term goals for each project. These were so important for me to map out so I could help direct my work week towards them.</span></p></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Set a schedule and stick to it!</i></span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, I set a schedule for my week. I know, I know, one of the benefits of freelancing is you can work whenever and wherever you want! You can sleep in, go on a hike in the middle of the day, have 3 coffee dates in the afternoon - it&rsquo;s the best! But there is something to be said about separating your work and play time. Whether you break up your day into 2 hour increments or decide to try out the traditional 9-5, set a schedule that works for you and protect it. You will find your work day more productive and you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy that happy hour with friends guilt free. Even though I despise early mornings, I started carpooling with my husband to work 3 days a week just to set a schedule for myself. I also found a collaborative workspace to go to so that I wouldn&rsquo;t spend all my time alone at home. Find something to help set yours and protect it when distractions come.</span></p></p>

</blockquote></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Follow the natural rhythm of the week.</i></span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While my work constantly changes the days of the week never do. <strong>In Jeremiah&rsquo;s article, he says that our &ldquo;peak energy&rdquo; is on Tuesday and Wednesday so we should schedule our &ldquo;Make Time&rdquo; on those days to be the most creatively productive.</strong> Thursday/Friday we are already gearing up for the weekend so we should focus those days on more social tasks like meetings, workshops or group sessions. </span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1477.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5596" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/MG_1477.jpg" alt="_MG_1477" width="700" height="467" /></a>I commit every Monday to business housekeeping.</strong> I start by working through all of the emails I gathered over the weekend. I set up meetings for the week (typically for Thursday or Friday) and try to find a new connection to make in my field. I also look at my 5 buckets and assign a day or half day to each one. This is huge for me because I no longer feel confined by a rigid schedule. I still work on the same projects every week but I may do commercial work on a Thursday one week and a Tuesday the next. <strong>The key is assigning my buckets every Monday so nothing gets lost or ignored in the week.</strong></span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most important thing to remember is our creative dreams are possible but they do take work. Thankfully with a little discipline we can make our work week work for our dreams.&nbsp;</span></p></p>
