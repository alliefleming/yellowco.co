<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bloom-Shoot-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2304" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bloom-Shoot-.jpg" alt="Bloom Shoot" width="700" height="466" /></a>My name is Emily and I am the Event Coordinator for The Yellow Conference. I&rsquo;ve been working as an Event Coordinator for the past 3 years, and I love it! I enjoy coming up with big ideas and concepts for an event, and dreaming of the finished product. I also like getting into the finer details of event planning, like putting together Excel spreadsheets, guest lists, budgets, contracts, and itineraries, and putting these two aspects together &ndash; the big and the small &ndash; to make an event happen!</p>
<p>My days differ from week-to-week. Aside from going to church on Sundays and Bible study on Wednesdays, there are very rarely two days (or nights) in my week that look the same.</p>
<p>A couple disclaimers before we start...First, when I reference &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t actually mean coffee; I can&rsquo;t stand the taste of coffee. I mean something more along the lines of a dirty chai (my favorite) or a white mocha. Second, a day in my life usually results in something like tripping up some stairs, spilling said &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; on my outfit of the day, or some other event along those lines. But hey, this is life and these are the things that remind you you&rsquo;re living it!</p>
<p>My day usually starts in the night. I&rsquo;m typically up into the wee hours of the morning working on homework or crossing off to-do&rsquo;s for The Yellow Conference. Sometimes a bowl of Reese&rsquo;s Puffs helps give me that extra ounce of motivation to keep on going.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2307" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0004.jpg" alt="YELLOW CONFERENCE BLOG" width="700" height="537" /></a>After I&rsquo;ve made some progress on my to-do list, or finished my homework that&rsquo;s due the following day, I&rsquo;ll get some sleep. Until my cat comes into my room begging for food, or the sun pours into my window &ndash; whichever one happens first. When this happens, the first thing I (try to) do is have a date with Jesus. Nothing starts my day off better and right than spending time with Him, and I find that the sooner I do it the better; otherwise I get distracted and busy with the day&rsquo;s to-do&rsquo;s that it just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0005.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2308" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0005.jpg" alt="YELLOW CONFERENCE BLOG" width="700" height="525" /></a>Once I&rsquo;ve had my quiet time, I&rsquo;ll pack my bag and head out to the door to school. I usually stop for "coffee" at this trendy little coffee shop called Starbucks (ever heard of it before?). Then, I&rsquo;ll head to school, park my car and finish any last-minute work before class. I graduate college this May so this won&rsquo;t be the norm for too much longer!</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0003.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2306" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0003.jpg" alt="YELLOW CONFERENCE BLOG" width="700" height="525" /></a>Head into class armed with my cup of caffeine and completed homework for the day. I&rsquo;m currently taking an Interpersonal Communications class, which I find fascinating! I may or may not doodle in my notes during class. And, in the name of total authenticity, I also may or may not scroll through Instagram once or twice, to get my inspirational photo fix for the day.</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0006.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2309" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_0006.jpg" alt="YELLOW CONFERENCE BLOG" width="700" height="525" /></a>Depending on the day, after class I may take the train to Downtown LA to scout out venues for The Yellow Conference, help with a photo shoot for The Yellow Conference, or have a meeting with Joanna, the founder of The Yellow Conference. And yes, that is a second cup of coffee. Don&rsquo;t judge.</p>

<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2520.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2311" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_2520.jpg" alt="YELLOW CONFERENCE BLOG" width="700" height="525" /></a>Again, depending on the day of the week, my night plans differ. Once a week, I host a small group of ladies at my house. This is our time to eat, connect with each other on a deeper, more intimate level, and pray for one another. Also once a week, I attend a Bible study with other college students. This is such a sweet time of gathering, and I always walk away encouraged by the people that are in my life. Some nights are spent having dinner with a friend whom I haven&rsquo;t seen in a while. Other nights are spent at home watching Gilmore Girls reruns, eating cookie butter, journaling and hanging with Gabe, my cat (who is terrified of cameras, and many other things; which is why you won&rsquo;t see him in any of these pictures).</p>
