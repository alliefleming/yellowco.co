<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the fourth and final(!)&nbsp;post in a new Sunday series by our <a href="http://yellowconference.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=3f8e45f74e0653e404965e2ef&amp;id=e811fb1a74">Yellow Collective</a> project manager </span></i><a href="http://www.laurencaselli.com/" target="_blank"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lauren Caselli</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about finding, creating, and growing a community of people who have your back. Whether it&rsquo;s online or in-person, free or paid, having a community of people who understand and support you can move you toward your goals faster than ever.

<p>Today, to wrap it all up, we&rsquo;re going to cover what happens when everyone goes home. How do you keep a community strong after an inspirational gathering? How do you encourage people to take action on the changes they want to make in their lives,&nbsp;and maintain lasting&nbsp;momentum of&nbsp;all the goodness from the gathering?</p>
<p>The goal of this series isn&rsquo;t just to help you meet new people; it&rsquo;s to help strengthen bonds of friendship so that you can go forth into the world with a veritable army of amazing supporters who will back you up during your world-changing missions.</p>
<h2><em>Here are four ways to keep the community you've built strong as it continues to build over time:&nbsp;</em></h2></p>
<h4><b>Help identify actions steps.</b></h4><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember at the end of <a href="http://yellowconference.com/2016/08/07/6408/" target="_blank">the last post</a> when I mentioned that you should encourage people to create an action step or a goal at the end of your gatherings? If your group is comfortable, you should go around and share your goals, write them down in a central location (my community and I have a shared Excel document), and review them at the beginning of your next gathering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, you don&rsquo;t even have to remind yourself or your peers about their goals; simply by writing them down and allowing them to be in the back of their minds is often enough for the goal to get completed by the next gathering.</span></p>
<h4><b>Take the discussion online (or offline!).</b></h4><br />
If your gatherings are in-person, create a Facebook group or a <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack channel</a> to keep each other updated on progress. If you&rsquo;re already meeting in a digital group over Google Hangout or Skype, schedule a meet-up far in advance or plan to do a retreat together at some point.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid169.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6576" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid169.jpg" alt="YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid(169)" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating various methods for people to connect and stay in touch with each other helps with the accomplishing of goals, but it also takes a &ldquo;once-a-month&rdquo; group (like a book club) to a prioritized circle of trusted advisors and friends. And that&rsquo;s what we all really want, right?</span></p>
<h4><b>Create a public method of accountability.</b></h4><br />
Perhaps it&rsquo;s assigning accountability buddies that meet every week to hold each other to goals or using one of your <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack hangouts</a> as a goals check-in.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&rsquo;s one thing to set a goal, and it&rsquo;s another to have a structured method of reviewing and revising those goals. Build in some public-facing accountability and see how those action steps get completed quicker than ever.<a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6630" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid54.jpg" alt="YellowCollectivexHeritage-AndreaDavid(54)" width="700" height="467" /></a></span><b>Follow up one-on-one with your other community members.</b></p>
<p>Group meetings can catalyze all sorts of changes, but those 1:1 conversations that your group members will have in between gatherings and online are the reason that a group like yours exists. Empower people to create connections and find others in the group that may be able to share wisdom around a tough issue. These connections are where people will&nbsp;be able to go deeper than is possible to go within a group.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400; color: #000000;">And if you&rsquo;re anything like me, you&rsquo;ll find that each person in your group serves a specific purpose, has a specific wisdom, and will be able to use their unique perspective to guide you toward your goals and your mission, even if it&rsquo;s not in a group setting.</span></span></p>
