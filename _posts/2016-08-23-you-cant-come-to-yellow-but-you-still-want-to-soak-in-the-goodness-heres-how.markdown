## _Hey girl!_

We are busy busy bees over here getting ready for Yellow in just TWO days. We're stoked!! This year is going to be amazing ladies, our best one yet.

Two full days at 440 Seaton spent hanging out with like minded women and crazy good speakers like Elle Luna, Jessica Hische, Jedediah Jenkins and Alexis Jones- we're ready for the roof to be blown off with all of the good vibes that will be filling the space.

All that being said, we know that not everyone can make it to the conference who wishes they could be there. Lucky for you we have a few ways for you to get involved from afar!

_**Here's how:**_

We're super sad you won't be able to make it to the conference in person this year, but there's always next year, right?? Luckily we live in a day and age where so much info and so many experiences can be shared with just a wifi connection.

That being said- we will see you on the interwebs gals! Can't wait!

Prepare ahead and follow us:
