<h2><em>Hey girl!</em></h2><br />
We are busy busy bees over here getting ready for Yellow in just TWO days. We're stoked!! This year is going to be amazing ladies, our best one yet.</p>
<p>Two full&nbsp;days at 440 Seaton spent hanging out with like minded women and&nbsp;crazy good&nbsp;speakers like Elle Luna, Jessica Hische, Jedediah Jenkins and Alexis Jones- we're ready for the roof to be blown off with all of the good vibes&nbsp;that will be filling the space.</p>
<p>All that being said, we know that not everyone can make it to the conference who wishes they could be there. Lucky for you we have a few ways for you to get involved from afar!</p>
<p><em><strong>Here's how:</strong></em></p>

<p>We're super sad you won't be able to make it to the conference in person this year, but there's always next year, right?? Luckily we live in a day and age where so much info and so many experiences can be shared with just a wifi connection.</p>
<p>That being said- we will see you on the interwebs gals! Can't wait!</p>
