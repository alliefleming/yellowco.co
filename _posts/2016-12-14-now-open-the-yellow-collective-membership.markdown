<p>Joanna Waterfall here (yes, that's my real last name)! I'm the founder of Yellow Co.- and can I take a second to be totally honest with you? Reading&nbsp;that headline above freaks me out. Like, sweaty palms and red face fear.</p>
<p>There are sooo many "what if's" that come with doing something new. We officially launched <a href="http://yellowcollective.com/" target="_blank">The Yellow Collective</a> at our conference this year, and&nbsp;we have learned so much through it all!</p>
<p><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Yellow2016-213.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-7478" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Yellow2016-213.jpg" alt="yellow2016-213" width="700" height="467" /></a></p>
<p>I'm super excited for the new things we have in store for the membership to make it an even more amazing experience for our members, but I'm also terrified- because it feels so BIG!</p>
<p><em><strong>But when I think about it- this is&nbsp;the reason I wanted to create Yellow in the first place. To have a safe, collaborative space for risk- taking women to know that they aren't alone in their journey. For them to build up&nbsp;the confidence it takes to do big things, because they know they have the support and encouragement of their ladies behind them.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>
<p>That's the best part of this membership.</p>
<p>It's a blast to get a fun box full of product in the mail, it's so much fun to learn and build our brands through the online resources, but it's the connections and the relationships that really make this membership so freaking RAD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>But FIRST THINGS FIRST.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>You're probably wondering what this whole membership is about, right?</strong></em></p>
<p>I'll start off by giving you the summary, then I'll dive a bit deeper. You decide how far you want to read!</p>
<h2>THE SUMMARY</h2><br />
The Yellow Collective&nbsp;is a membership platform for creative, risk taking women who want to make this world a better place. That means YOU!</p>
<p><em>The membership comes with...</em></p>
<p><strong>&bull; A quarterly package with some goodies delivered to your door.</strong><br />

<p>That's the short version.&nbsp;At this point you're probably asking yourself,</p>
<p> <em><strong>"Joanna, this all sounds fine and dandy, but I work hard for my paycheck, and I'm not putting my money just&nbsp;anywhere, so I'm going to need you to&nbsp;elaborate a bit..."</strong></em> </p>
<p>To which I would answer, "WHY YES OF COURSE, I'D BE HAPPY TO!"</p>
<p>I'll start off by elaborating a bit more about the <strong>EMPOWERMENT BOXES</strong> the membership comes with. Sound good?</p>
<p> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-7475" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Yellow2016-207.jpg" alt="yellow2016-207" width="700" height="1050" /> </p>
<h2>1. THE EMPOWERMENT BOX</h2><br />
 First off, every quarter we have a theme. You may have seen us post about it on <a href="http://yellowconference.com/2016/10/03/our-next-series-heart/" target="_blank">our blog.</a> </p>
<p>The cool thing about these themes is that we don't stop at the blog- they play a huge part in the Collective- aaand the EMPOWERMENT BOX.</p>
<p>Because of that, you'll have goodies in the box that are centered around our theme.</p>
<p><em><strong>Each Empowerment Box comes with..</strong></em><br />
<em>&bull; One do-good product<br />
&bull; A book to read together with the collective ladies<br />
&bull; An 8.5 x 11 print centered around the theme<br />
&bull; A set of 3 postcards, 2 for you and 1 with the address of another member. The idea here is to write a note of encouragement to another member!<br />
&bull; Other fun surprises&nbsp;from our team<br />
&bull; A letter from us, and information surrounding the quarter</em></p>
<p><strong>To get a real feel for them, here are a few photos from our members who have 'grammed their boxes when they arrive!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> As you can see, these boxes bring extra joy and empowerment to the lives of so many of our members. Goodness I love these ladies... </p>
<p>One thing I want to mention...&nbsp;although the box is the most purley physical product we offer, the membership is NOT centered around this box.</p>
<p>In a world full of subscription boxes (which we love), this is definetly not that!!</p>
<p>The box is a small portion of the larger community and membership. If you are interested in purchasing JUST a box, head to <a href="https://yellowco.myshopify.com/collections/empowerment-boxes?nopreview" target="_blank">our shop</a>!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, you may be saying...</p>
<p> <em><strong>"That box thing looks cool, I doo love snail mail... but still...&nbsp;my money is hard earned (#entrepreneurlife, hellooo!) and I'm not yet convinced. I'm going to need something more here.."</strong></em> </p>
<p>TOTALLY GET IT.<br />
LET'S DIVE IN A BIT DEEPER, SHALL WE?</p>
<p>Let me start off by telling you a bit about the digital resources portion of the membership and what that means...</p>
<h2> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-7476" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MG_1412.jpg" alt="_mg_1412" width="700" height="1050" /> </h2></p>
<h2> 2. THE DIGITAL RESOURCES<br />
 </h2><br />
 Just like the boxes, these digital resources are centered around our theme for the quarter. Our goal is to have everything connected and cohesive! </p>
<p><em><strong>The Digital Resources consist of...</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&bull; One 15 - 20 pg. Workbook centered around the theme</strong><br />
 This is meant to help you dive into your self development. We recommend&nbsp;printing it out, pouring yourself a hot cup of coffee and heading to a quite place with just your workbook and a pen. It's like a date with yourself and your development! If you'd like to see a sample few pages from a past workbook, feel free to download our free sample:&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/3f8e45f74e0653e404965e2ef/files/GRIT_workbook_Exercise_1.pdf" target="_blank">CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD</a></em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>&bull; FREE admission to our quarterly online conference</strong><br />
This past quarter we hosted our first ever online conference. It went so well we decided to do it <em>once a quarter</em>! Read all about it <a href="http://yellowcollective.leadpages.co/yellow-collective-digital-conference/" target="_blank">here</a>. Collective members get in FO FREE ($127 value) and have access to the recordings as well.</p>
<p><strong>&bull; A "community challenge" worksheet</strong><br />
This is a new addition to the Collective! We will be hosting a quarterly community challenge centered around our theme. This is to encourage our members to get out and DO, and to hold each other accountable for doing it! Helping you step out and step into being more of the person you were created to be.</p>
<p><strong>&bull; An exclusive Yellow Conference ticket price &amp; perks&nbsp;</strong><br />
That's right, you get an exclusive Yellow Conference ticket price and access to perks &amp; special members only events at our conference. Tickets for the conference go on sale in January.</p>
<p><strong>PLUS...</strong><br />
&bull; Vault of past quarter's videos, e-courses and worksheets<br />
&bull; Weekly email filled with thoughts, take away tips and info<br />
&bull; Exclusive bonus material and other online seminars throughout the quarter</p>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p> The overall goal of these digital resources is to give you the guidance&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;<strong>hone in on your strengths, be challenged, and become&nbsp;the best version of yourself you can be!</strong> That's what's going to make you&nbsp;both a better business owner and more content, fulfilled human in all areas of your life. </p>
<p>The coolest part is that you get to do it with a community who is supporting you throughout the entire thing.</p>

<p>Which brings me to...<br />
<img class="aligncenter wp-image-7477" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Yellow2016-442.jpg" alt="yellow2016-442" width="700" height="1050" /></p>
<h2>3. THE COMMUNITY</h2><br />
 My core desire with Yellow is to provide women with a safe &amp; genuine community. A place where they feel seen, heard, and can completely be who they are. </p>
<p>Bringing the messiness, weirdness, the complicatedness (is that a word?), the badassery, the strengths, the hardships and everything in between. Embraced with no judgement, just love.</p>
<p><em><strong>The coolest part is, once these women have been given the space to be who they were created to be, gotten&nbsp;inspired and made new friendships, it's THEN that&nbsp;they can then go out into the world, TAKE ACTION and DO GOOD.</strong></em></p>
<h2><em>THAT'S CALLED CHANGING THE WORLD PEOPLE.</em></h2><br />
The final portion of The Yellow Collective is the COMMUNITY.</p>
<p><em><strong>The community consists of...</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>&bull; If you are in an area with a local chapter <em>(OR if you get 5 or more people to sign up in your town)</em> you'll be able to attend our monthly in person gatherings <em>(see below for current chapters!).</em></strong><br />
 This is a place where our members get to connect with each other on a local level. We have monthly discussion topics and a standard way of running our gatherings to make sure everyone is able to get to know each other and connect on a deeper level! </p>
<p>Our current chapters are:<br />
<em><strong>Orange County<br />
Long Beach<br />
West LA<br />
DTLA<br />
LA- The Valley<br />
San Diego</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Oakland, CA<br />
New York, NY<br />
Washington DC<br />
Tulsa, OK<br />
Cincinnati, OH<br />
Raleigh, NC<br />
Seattle, WA<br />
Denver, CO</strong></em></p>
<p> If you don't see your city here, <strong>get 5 or more people to sign up in your local area and we will start an in person chapter there! </strong>If you aren't able to do that, we have monthly&nbsp;digital gatherings for our members outside our chapter areas. </p>
<p><strong>&bull; 24/7 Slack Channel and Private Facebook group</strong><br />
 Our Slack channel is a great way for our members to connect with each other nationally. Every week we host Slack chats online, centered around a theme for that week. Our Facebook group is a new addition to the membership this quarter! We plan on hosting Facebook Live events, posting photos from our various chapter gatherings,&nbsp;and other fun ways to keep up with other members from all over the country. </p>
<p><strong>&bull; Book Club</strong><br />
 Remember me mentioning the book that comes in the box? It's an awesome feeling to know that members from all over the country are reading the book together!&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>&bull; Encouragement Pals</strong><br />
 We include a postcard in the Empowerment Box addressed to another woman in the community, so if everyone sends a note, all community members will receive postcards to and from each other! </p>
<p><strong>&bull; Community Challenge</strong><br />
 As we mentioned previously, we will be hosting a community challenge every quarter. The idea is that the members hold each other accountable to accomplishing the challenge, because challenges are always better when we do them together, right? </p>
<p><strong>PLUS...</strong><br />
 &bull; Weekly Slack Chats <br />
 &bull; Various online community convos <br />
 &bull; Private Instagram access </p>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p> The goal is to have a Yellow Collective chapter in EVERY major city in the states! These are definitely&nbsp;a highlight of the membership and we would love to start a chapter in your city. </p>
<p>Community is where we grow, where we learn more about who we are, where we can learn how to think differently and encourage one another. It's truly awesome to see the growth from so many of our members after being apart of this community. The world is CHANGING Y'ALL!</p>
