Heard about our membership, the [Yellow Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/) but are still wondering what it actually looks like to be a member? Today our vivacious and incredible New York Chapter Co-leader, [Jennifer Mingucci](https://www.instagram.com/jenwithlime/), is here to share her experience of the [Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/).

#### What drew you to the [Yellow Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/) in the first place?

I am Vice President of Operations at [Kidville](http://www.kidville.com/), which is a small franchise company specializing in kids classes, birthday parties, and events for newborns up to 5 years. My focus is on fostering the talent. I lead a team that spans from the West Coast to the East Coast, and am always searching for inspiration and direction.

In the summer of 2016, I saw posts from the [Yellow Conference](http://yellowco.co/conference/) and was so moved by the environment, aesthetics, and amazing stories being shared. I literally saved a picture from a mural made at Yellow, and then made a similar one for my own team training!

### I knew I had to join to explore more of what Yellow had to offer to not only enrich my own life, but give me tools, stories, and inspiration for my team at large.

#### If you could describe your Yellow chapter in one word, what would it be? Why?

ENGAGED! This chapter of women is incredibly engaged in pursuing their passions, making connections, learning from one another, and sharing their unique stories. Their soul lights are ON and you feel like you can truly SEE one another and BE SEEN.

#### Has being a part of the [Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/) inspired any big changes in your life?

YES, the Collective has brought me out of hiding. I was building a life in my comfort zone. Joining the Collective was the first of now many steps I have taken out of it. I have made real connections here and sparked a desire to help other women thrive.

#### What does community mean to you?

The Yellow community was the door to my future. I am incredibly grateful for that first step through, and have been surrounded by nothing by positivity, encouragement, and FIERCE sisterhood. This community keeps me balanced, while also propelling me forward to a future that is filled with vulnerability, authenticity, and tons of opportunity to FAIL FORWARD!

#### What does an evening with the NYC chapter of the [Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/) look like?

GIRL, it looks amazing! It is one of my favorite nights that I truly look forward to each month. From the outside, it looks like a bunch of old friends having a reunion. From the inside, it is new and old friends connecting, sharing insights, asking questions, laughing, and building one another up!

REAL DEETS: We always supply some drinks (August was Prosecco Popcicles), snacks (guac anyone?), and a cozy nook to get comfortable in. Josie and I try to create an environment that is welcoming and conducive to sharing.

#### As a leader, have you been able to experience any incredible stories from the women in your chapter?

Our stories are 100000% what bind us together. I have seen women grow their brands, leave their full time jobs, improve their client intake, re-brand their own brands, pivot their services, hire employees, and MORE.

### The Yellow Collective has created a space for every woman to join in - whatever season, or spot on her journey she is in.

#### Who are the top three Beyoncé’s of your life?

First is my mom! She is the Steel Magnolia of my family. She is the first example of female strength I witnessed and her endless love and encouragement has let my true self thrive each and every day.

Second, would Cheryl Strayed! When I read Wild, I was actually on a trip with my mother and each word I read forever changed my soul. She taught me that we need to accept our imperfections as necessary pillars to fulfilling our true potential.

Lastly, Brené Brown with her vulnerability realness. The first time I saw [her TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability), my entire world stopped - I realized the power of being vulnerable and seen in the arena. Her message on how to live a whole life is MUST READ content.

#### What is the biggest lesson you have learned from your fellow Yellow ladies?

I have learned that REST is just as valuable of a commodity as PRODUCTION. As leaders in life, we often feel the pressure to carry others, but rest is needed in order to perform. I have been given permission to replenish and rest from this group!
