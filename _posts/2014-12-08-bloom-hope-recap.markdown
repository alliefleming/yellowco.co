Last month was a special version of our Bloom Gatherings, called "Bloom for Hope." We partnered up with [Coast to Coast Central](http://www.coasttocoastcentral.com/) to give 100% of the event profits to create sustainable change for survivors of sex trafficking in Ecuador. Through the funds raised, we were able to pay for one girl to go through rehabilitation! This consists of getting a home, counseling sessions to help with inner healing, educational classes, business classes, and skills training. Her rehabilitation will equip her to enter back into society as a strong woman who both dreams and leads. This community is making a powerful difference in the world and that is SO exciting!!

We had yummy bites and sips at [Little Meats LA](http://littlemeatsla.com/), the awesome community venue who hosted us.

[La Fleur Kitchen](http://lafleurkitchen.com/) supplied the beautiful blooms that filled the venue and [Joanne Pio](http://joannepio.com/) documented the night.

We had [The Giving Keys](http://www.thegivingkeys.com/) join us, and they donated 15% of their sales from that night to the cause. [Hana Kim](http://www.hanakim.org/hanakim/News/News.html) was our musical guest, and she donated 50% of her album sales that night to the cause. Blythe from [Dressember](http://www.dressemberfoundation.org/) came and told her story of how she started a movement that has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to fight human trafficking globally. (Any [#Dressember](http://websta.me/tag/dressember) participants out there?)

We had the opportunity to write letters to the women in the rehabilitation center in Ecuador. We poured out our hearts to these girls. Telling them they are loved, they are worth loving, and they have sisters in the United States fighting and praying for them.

It truly was a special night of community gathering together for good. A lot of good conversations were had, eyes were opened, new relationships were formed and old relationships were strengthened.

You can check out the [#bloomgathering](http://iconosquare.com/tag/bloomgathering) and [#bloomforhope](http://iconosquare.com/tag/bloomforhope) hashtags to get a feel for the event.

Our next Bloom Gathering is happening on December 15th at [Share and Do Good](http://www.shareanddogood.com/)'s storefront. Share & Do Good is a giving boutique located in Downtown Fullerton who's goal is to bring you good designs made by great causes that tell amazing stories of hope from around the world. They will be giving us 10% off all items in their shop that night! So come ready to do some mingling, eating, cause based Christmas shopping, and community building!

The event is free (must [RSVP](https://ti.to/yellowconference/bloom-gathering-christmas-party)), but we are asking you to bring something yummy to eat (appetizer style is perfect!), good to drink, or a toy unwrapped and ready to give. We will be collecting toys to donate to Toys for Tots.

So come join us! This is our first event in the Orange County area, so hopefully we will see some new faces and get to meet more of you!

We have a limited amount of spots, so be sure to [RSVP here](https://ti.to/yellowconference/bloom-gathering-christmas-party) to grab your ticket. Have a good one ladies!
