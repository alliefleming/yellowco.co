[![YELLOW CO. KICKSTARTER](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-1421986527537-888d998adb74.jpg)](http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/photo-1421986527537-888d998adb74.jpg)

In the midst of all the craziness of this month with our Kickstarter Campaign happening, we want to pause and remember **why **we are so invested in this project in the first place: **you. **

Our followers. The faithful ones who've been around since our first conference, and the newest additions to our Yellow Tribe...**you** are the reason we are reaching out and building on this project and mission more and more everyday.

Without **you, **this movement would not be possible. The Yellow Co. is committed to empowering women from all generations and backgrounds to _spread good and bloom. _And The Yellow Room is another chapter of this.

Today, we want to pause and take a look at how Yellow Co. has impacted women from **across the nation **to use their gifts for good:

_The Yellow Conference for me was just the beginning. After walking out of the conference, I knew that I wanted my skills and my time to be used for something beyond just myself. That night I was looking through Facebook and saw a job posting for Krochet Kids intl, a non-profit with a mission to empower women in Uganda and Peru, and submitted my application then and there. I got a call back the following Monday, set up an interview, got the job, quit my job, and the rest was history. It was a crazy series of events I was not prepared for but I was ready to take the leap because of the inspiration and the courage through Yellow._

--Michelle Kim, [Krochet Kids Intl.](http://www.krochetkids.org/)

_The Yellow Conference came at such a transitional time for me. My husband and I were getting ready to move thousands of miles to be apart of the growing process of a small business. So my heart was seeking hard for encouragement and a charge. Yellow delivered! I found myself being wrapped in encouraging words, being built up in bravery and overwhelmed with inspiration. It surpassed all of my expectations. It is such a gift to meet one person with a love of creative encouragement and here I found myself in a room full of like minded people! All genuine. I have such a passion to grow as a person, as a blog and as an artist alongside a life giving tribe and Yellow brought me into one. I am still spurred on by that beautiful August conference and it's now April! I cannot wait for Yellow 2015! _

--Barb Groves, 2014 Yellow Conference Attendee

_I have been so blessed by the community of bloggers. The way people share so vulnerably and authentically inspires me to celebrate my own story. As we come together, and dive into the inner layers of our created selves, we inspire others to do the same. _

--Bekah Pogue, [blogger + speaker](http://www.upcycledjane.com/)

_ My friend and I stumbled across our first Yellow Gathering this past December. As college students when we were first approached by the Ladies of Yellow we were asked who we were as human beings, what we're passionate about and what we feel we are called to do- questions that we as students don't really get asked about. I didn't get to attend the conference last year but I heard about it because one of my favorite bloggers/writers spoke at it and I knew if it was something she was tied to then I needed to find out more. _

_ My experience with Yellow has shifted, molded and shaped me into the creative human being I am and will become. This community of women is crucial for stories and students like myself but for women frantically searching for a way to make this world a better and more beautiful place. Being able to call myself a part of this yellow community has inspired, given me hope for after graduation and allowed me to see that when we truly engage with one another and utilize our gifts, we literally can change the freaking world._

--Arielle Estoria, [blogger + speaker](http://chroniclesofalioness.com/)

_Yellow is a safe place where women can let down their guards, knowing they don't have to be concerned with petty competition or judgement. I have always heard more can be accomplished when like minded people are united, but being apart of Yellow has allowed me to see it in practice, inspiring me to live more purposefully and selflessly in both my professional and personal life._

--Ali Mooney, Graphic Designer

_The team at Yellow has such a beautiful vision for connecting women in a new innovative way! They have inspired me to be more ambitious and brave when it comes to growing my business and my friendships._

--Alexis Reddy, [blogger + closet consultant](http://alexisatarian.com/)

_ I had the privilege of meeting the Yellow team and experiencing my first Bloom Gathering in February this year. To say it changed my perspective and helped me find purpose may sound like an exaggeration - but there aren’t many other words that ring true. Watching the Yellow team put on the Bloom Gathering, as well as working closely with them for the Kickstarter made me realize that this is more than just a Conference and a Gathering. It’s about bringing together women to share dreams, success stories and empower them to do more. I left the Bloom Gathering that evening with a vision and goal, and with this community + inspiration, it’s already coming to fruition. Location shouldn’t be a limitation for this community. This is why we need The Yellow Room – a** digital**hub for creative world changers._

--Sarah Heyl, [Harbr Co.](http://harbr.co/)

**THIS **is why we do what we do. Yellow Co. is committed to seeing more stories like these, stories of inspiration and challenge and pure **thriving **throughout the world. **But, again, we cannot do this without you! **

If each reader from our blog **today **donated $5 to our Kickstarter, we will meet our goal...Consider giving towards the movement, spread the word, tell your friends. The mission of Yellow is to see good spread, and we believe this is our next step deeper into that mission.
