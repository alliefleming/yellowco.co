<p><strong><em>(Psssttt....Did you know this year we are offering a live-stream of the Yellow Conference?! Grab your ticket <a href="https://ti.to/yellowconference/yellow-conference-2015" target="_blank">here!!</a>)</em></strong></p>
<p>My heart was bursting with excitement when I first discovered Yellow Conference. Two days in a room buzzing with inspiring speakers and hands-on workshops? Yes, please! After graduating a year ago and jumping into the 8-5 routine, the challenge to remain inspired still feels like a pretty fresh struggle. Yellow Conference offers a remedy to re-energize and find new purpose in the everyday. With August just around the corner, my co-worker and I jumped on planning a trip to sunny Los Angeles, only to discover our resources and funds fell short.</p>
<p>It was tempting to feel defeated, but being determined women we decided to get creative instead. We&rsquo;re taking advantage of the live-streaming ticket and planning our very own Yellow Conference party &ndash; and we think you should too! Below I&rsquo;ve outlined some helpful steps to get started:</p>

<strong>Gather your Tribe:</strong><br />
In addition to inviting your best buds, I encourage you to step outside your comfort zone and reach out to bloggers, teachers, designers, etc. in your local community. There&rsquo;s nothing more inspiring than getting a room full of uniquely creative people together, not to mention you&rsquo;re creating your own opportunity for networking &ndash; how cool is that?</p>
<p><strong>Choose a Location:</strong><br />
Find a space that&rsquo;s both comfortable and functional. You can keep it simple by throwing a party at your house or apartment &ndash; buy fresh flowers and a few simple decorations to make the streaming feel extra special. Better yet, get your tribe together before the event and DIY some decorations together! Or if you desire something a little different, reach out to community workspaces in your area, coffee shops or a local Bed &amp; Breakfast. The event can be as big or small as you want it to be. <em>[Pro Tip: Make sure to choose a space with great lighting for photos...and share them using #bloomyellow!]</em></p>

<p><strong>Plan Your Own Workshops:</strong><br />
There&rsquo;s nothing more satisfying than putting what you learned to practice, so I recommend planning a couple in-person activities to do as a group. This can be a great chance to reach out to some of the local talent in your community to see if they&rsquo;d be willing to lead a small workshop. Chances are you have friends with talents that are worth sharing!</p>
<p><strong>Supplies:</strong><br />
In addition to making sure you&rsquo;re in a location with excellent Wi-Fi, you&rsquo;ll want to choose the best way to stream the event for your party. Whether that&rsquo;s renting a projector for the day, having individuals on their laptops with headphones or streaming the event on your TV, plan ahead to reduce the chance of (preventable) technical difficulties. I also suggest bringing lots of snacks and goodies to enjoy. Pick a theme and make it a potluck or reach out to a local bakery for some extra sweet treats!</p>
<p><strong>My last recommendation is to make sure you really have fun with it.</strong> It can be tempting to feel as though the cool things only happen in places like Los Angeles. The online arena makes it all too easy to jump to the fear of missing out on something. I encourage you to challenge this notion and instead make the most out of what you have, where you are. This is a chance to #bloomtogether &ndash; regardless of distance or location. How will&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;be joining the party?</p>
