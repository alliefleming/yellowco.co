In 2011, Samantha moved to Los Angeles to further her acting career.&nbsp;Her entire life changed in February of 2013 when she discovered that she had an&nbsp;identical twin sister. This remarkable experience ignited a desire in Samantha to&nbsp;explore the world of adoption by assisting fellow adoptees and their surrounding&nbsp;communities. Growing up without the insight of other adoptees, she wanted&nbsp;to share a positive outlook on adoption and explore the ways in which family is&nbsp;deeper than DNA.</em></p>

Incase you missed it, we have added a <a href="http://yellowconference.com/conference/3-day-atmittance/" target="_blank">third day</a> filled with just workshops this year. We decided to add this because we saw a desire from our attendees to get more practical application. Practical advice is hard to give in a keynote session.</p>
<p>So this year, you can get all the inspiration and good vibes from the 2-day conference, then head to the third workshop day on Saturday, and put it all into practice.</p>
<p>We will be releasing workshop titles and instructors in the next few weeks here! Keep an eye out.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to this being our best conference yet.&nbsp;Hope you come hang out with us&nbsp;this August!</p>
