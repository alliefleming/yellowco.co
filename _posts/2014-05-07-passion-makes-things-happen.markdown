<p>The definition of passion: "an intense desire or enthusiasm for something." Definition of apathy: "lack of interest, enthusiasm, or concern."</p>
<p>I think that sums it up right there. Passionate people make things happen because of one thing: they<em> care.</em></p>
<p>Think about it: you want to make things happen in the world? Figure out what do you care about. What makes your heart beat fast, what makes your blood boil? What makes you feel&nbsp;<em>alive</em>? It can be difficult to find- but I believe when we stop and pay attention to how something is making us feel, we can find what we care about, what we're enthusiastic about, what we're passionate about. It might not be the cool thing- it might be something you've never seen anyone else show passion for. But if you feel deeply about something, don't ignore that feeling. You have the power to change the world. Let go of your fear and embrace your passion.</p>
