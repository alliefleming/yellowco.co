<p>The Yellow Conference is officially over and it. was. amazing. The air was buzzing with the energy and positivity of our amazing attendees. What an inspiring&nbsp;group of women.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned in our last post, at Yellow Conference this year, we launched our brand new membership platform, <a href="http://yellowcollective.co/" target="_blank">The Yellow Collective</a>! Launching the </span><a href="http://yellowcollective.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellow Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been nothing short of a DREAM. It's so exciting to see so many badass creatives wanting to join this community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YELLOW-COLLECTIVE-BLOG-IMAGE-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6811" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/YELLOW-COLLECTIVE-BLOG-IMAGE-1.jpg" alt="YELLOW COLLECTIVE BLOG IMAGE 1" width="700" height="1050" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But before the </span><a href="http://yellowconference.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there were the original brave and bold ladies willing to step into this experiment with us and soak it all in. We call them our beta group &mdash; and since they've been apart of the Collective from the beginning, we wanted to hear their stories and let them share what they've learned from this growing group of women!</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sincerelyames/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amy Garner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a stylist for </span><a href="http://www.stelladot.com/sites/AmyGarner"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stella &amp; Dot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and original Yellow Collective lady, was struggling to find other women her age that share her entrepreneurial mindset &mdash; something that can be difficult to find as a work-from-home freelancer! She recently told us that she feels </span><a href="http://yellowcollective.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yellow Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has become the community of creative women she was searching for. &nbsp;"<em>I'm a firm believer that we should never settle and always be learning &mdash; learning more about ourselves, each other, and the world we live in,"</em> she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"<em><strong>This is definitely a community that has fostered that ideal...we can learn from each other and grow together as individuals and a community.</strong>"</em></span></p>

She told us, "<em>I love hearing the insight, inspiration and passions of these women. It's nice to know there are other women striving to make a difference and willing to lean on each other for support, growth and laughter!</em>"&nbsp;</span> As entrepreneurs, it can be a struggle to let on that there even IS a struggle! </p>
<h2><em><strong>There's a constant pressure to seem like we have it all together, that we've figured it out, but our goal as a Collective is to offer women a place to share what's actually going on in their lives and find collaboration and care from their local creative community.</strong></em></h2></p>
<p>You all know the drill &mdash; collaboration over competition. We want to promote realness every step of the way! <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-50.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6804" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-50.jpg" alt="Yellow2016-50" width="700" height="1050" /></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shayarees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaya Rees</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an administrative assistant at the </span><a href="http://negu.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessie Rees Foundation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and one of the most motivated young creatives we've met, expressed wanting a community where she could be open and honest.&nbsp;"</span><a href="http://yellowcollective.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Yellow Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been the greatest blessing in my life lately," she said. "<strong><em>I have an incredible group of women who encourage me, push me, teach me, and share their wisdom. It's a place where I feel safe and know that I can be vulnerable...They teach me to be myself, trust the path that I am on, and never stop pursing [my] dreams!</em></strong>"</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">While there's nothing wrong with networking events and passing around business cards to new potential colleagues, Cassidy Perry, a social media coach and web manager told us that the Collective has been a "wonderful and delightful surprise" that didn't fit the traditional networking model.&nbsp;"<em><strong>What I found was genuinely caring young women who care about helping each other grow in all areas of life and business,</strong></em>" she said.</span> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-6806" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-135.jpg" alt="Yellow2016-135" width="700" height="1050" /> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><em><strong>"This is truly a unique group of women who don't just talk about supporting each other but truly show up and are there for each other...I've gained confidence that business can be done with vulnerability and kindness. You don't have to be cutthroat to succeed.</strong></em></span><em><strong>"</strong></em> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes us SO ecstatic to see </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://yellowcollective.co/">Yellow Collective</a>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ladies feeling safe and encouraged within this growing group of awesome women. Even though it can be hard to step out and share your gifts with others, Collective member&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/flyingfreediaries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zantika Ellis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reminded us that it's SO worth it. "<em><strong>I've learned to step out of my comfort zone and to be okay with the anxiety that comes with doing so,</strong></em>" she said.&nbsp;</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Here were a few other tidbits that members felt were highlights of the past couple quarters!</span> <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-65.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6797" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-65.jpg" alt="Yellow2016-65" width="700" height="1050" /></a> <b>The Quarterly Empowerment Box:</b> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sfitzgerald11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sara Fitzgerald</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (remember &mdash; "the creative in the cornfields") let us know how much joy her box brought her! She shared, "That box was like a ray of sunshine sitting on my porch, full of things to inspire, resources and wisdom!"&nbsp;</span> <b>Exclusive Online Content:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A few weeks back, we had the honor of hosting an exclusive members-only Q&amp;A with </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lindseyeryn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindsey Eryn Clark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who founded </span><a href="http://www.wildheartswknd.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wild Hearts Wknd</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (one of our faves)! "The entrepreneur chat was amazing," said social media and web expert&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cassidyperry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cassidy Perry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. "She had so much simple wisdom and a down-to-earth approach to work and life. Plus I LOVED that both our hosts weren't made up [with hair and makeup]...Most people are afraid that if they don't look perfect, no one will take them seriously, but within 30 seconds of these two women speaking on business and valor, I knew I was listening to some truly brilliant people."</span> <b>Slack Chats:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Every Wednesday evening, we host a Slack Chat on a different topic! We've discussed creativity, vulnerability, boundaries &mdash; you name it! No matter where our members are, the chats offer a place to connect on a regular basis! "I've gained a strong sense of community from our weekly Slack Chats as we shower each other with encouragement, wisdom, and tools to utilize in our everyday lives," shared </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/britneylclark/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Britney Clark</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a speaker and financial professional. "<em>I've learned we're all connected in some way.</em>"</span> <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-54.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6801" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-54.jpg" alt="Yellow2016-54" width="700" height="1050" /></a> <b>Access to the Yellow Team &amp; other awesome women: </b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/marissahopeblog/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marissa Rascon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the awesome lady who made our </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/180004980"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yellow Collective promo video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aired at conference, shared the highlight of her membership. "My favorite part was learning from real-life entrepreneurs and spending time with </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/joannawaterfall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the Yellow team," she said. "I gained a tribe of badass business-minded babes who are hilarious, humble and kind." &nbsp;</span> <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-103.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6803" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Yellow2016-103.jpg" alt="Yellow2016-103" width="700" height="1050" /></a> <a style="color: #ffffff; text-decoration: none; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; padding: 10px; display: inline-block; max-width: 700px; border-radius: 5px; text-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.247059) 0px -1px 1px; box-shadow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.498039) 0px 1px 3px inset, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.498039) 0px 1px 3px; background: #000000;" href="https://yellowcollective.leadpages.co/leadbox/14048ef73f72a2%3A17a2246bc746dc/5732568548769792/" target="_blank">WANT MORE INFO?
