**Connecting with your tribe and staying true to yourself are the keys to making social media a positive experience.**

...So what is a tribe? Your tribe is a group of people who are like-minded and share the same values as you. Finding our tribe helps us ground ourselves and stick to what we believe in. Here are some tips for doing just that.

**Know who you are and what you are all about.**

What makes you different? What makes you happy? What do you want to share with the world? How do you want to make people feel? What do you believe in?

**Who is paving the way for you?**

> _Starting these connections helped me focus on what I wanted and empowered me to stick with my values._

When I first started my business, I was a little lost on social media. Not because I didn’t know what I was doing, but because I couldn’t find anyone that believed what I believe about marketing. For me, it’s all about small connections and empowering people, not about shaming them for what they are doing "wrong" or differently. I was very frustrated, but then I started following some people that opened up my network to the kind of people I wanted to connect with. One person had the same exact values as me and was doing what I wanted to be doing. She was just the sweetest and made people feel good about marketing. The other was [Yellow Co.](http://yellowconference.com/) I found them and I was like, “Yes! These are the type of people I want to be around.” They are kind, care about what they are doing and are lifting their followers up. Starting these connections helped me focus on what I wanted and empowered me to stick with my values.

**Find mentors**

So you found some people that you feel aligned with, what do you do next? Pick one or two and email them! Tell them what you admire about them, how they are doing what you want to be doing and ask if they can mentor you. Keep in mind that many people charge for mentorship services. I did hire someone that I really connected with, and it has been so worth it. You get access to their network, and they teach you how to stick to your guns and pursue what you truly believe.

**Be honest and open.**

> _Let your personality shine bright. Share your expertise loud and proud. Position yourself as a leader and be that person people are like, “Yes! She gets me.” Be honest (in a professional manner) and you will attract people like you._

I am an introvert and actually quite shy in person. I definitely take a different approach to social media. I make one connection at a time and create small goals. Overtime, these small connections have extended my network in a significant way. I talk very openly about my struggles and lead many conversations about it. I write blog posts about it and talk about it on Instagram quite often. This attracts people who are like-minded and want to know what you have to say about overcoming it. This encourages really positive conversations and allows you to speak what you believe in and what people can expect of you. At the end of the day, you are attracting ideal clients or customers.

Using hashtags that speak to like-minded people can be a game changer. Many of my consult clients are introverts. So on Instagram I often use the hashtag #introvert or other hashtags that speak to the personality of my ideal client. You can also get really specific about hashtags. To do this, follow people that have hired you or bought your product, see what hashtags they are using and use those. If you do this successfully and creatively, you will attract more people like them. Besides using the hashtags, you can click on them and start conversations with other people who use them. Easy peasy, right?

**Facebook groups.**

Facebook groups are a great resource to find like-minded people. Find groups that speak to your personality and your expertise. I am in several groups and I have found that joining various Facebook groups has expanded my network greatly. Some of my favorite groups are women entrepreneur support groups.

**Be you!**

This is something that everyone says, but it is _so true._ Let your personality shine bright. Share your expertise loud and proud. Position yourself as a leader and be that person people are like, “Yes! She gets me.” Be honest (in a professional manner) and you will attract people like you. And remember, confidence is the result not a prerequisite. Put yourself out there even if you are unsure people will receive you well. Chances are they will and that will help build your confidence.
