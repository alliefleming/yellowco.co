<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6086" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6.jpg" alt="lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6" width="700" height="500" /></a>This skin,<br />
</span><span class="s1">Has always been a golden reflection of a <em>radiance<br />
</em></span><span class="s1">I didn&rsquo;t know was already in my veins</span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This skin, has my Mother's face but her grandmothers tone<br />
</span><span class="s1">This skin smiles like her Father and verbally rambles like him too<br />
</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My siblings are all various shades of chocolate and caramel<br />
</span><span class="s1">We are the candy store; my great-grandmother always saw the sign<br />
</span><span class="s1"><strong>NO C O L O R E D S</strong><br />
</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This world,<br />
</span><span class="s1">Has a dangerous way of reminding me who I am<br />
</span><span class="s1">Pulls history out of its pockets like a taunting reminder that this life I live,<br />
</span><span class="s1">Was not founded on ease<br />
</span><strong><span class="s1">It is built on sacrifice and lives taken<br />
</span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>Built on railroad tracks and Selma marches</strong><br />
</span><strong><span class="s1">I am wondering, when will I start feeling my ancestors in my tongue<br />
</span></strong><span class="s1">When will they start to speak on behalf in the midst of my occasional ignorance<br />
</span><span class="s1">When will they begin to start pumping in my heart too conditioned in living in the present? </span></p></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">I am wondering, when our world will stop backwards stumbling into a place coated in hate based off of how you look or how you love<br />
</span></h4></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">This skin, is not a threat<br />
</span><span class="s1">This love, is not a threat</span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My brother is many shades darker than me<br />
</span><span class="s1">He looks like all the little boys I keep seeing in twitter hash tags and on t-shirts<br />
</span><span class="s1">My brother is nine years old and already over five foot<br />
</span><span class="s1">Everyone, would see his skin as a threat<br />
</span><span class="s1">Until you know what it is like to cuddle his still small body in your hands<br />
</span><span class="s1">You will not see...<strong>that he is nothing like a threat</strong></span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have friends, whose color in comparison to mine would be seen <strong>outrageous</strong> if we dared stepped&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">anywhere together<br />
</span><span class="s1"><strong>We are the reminders, that we are moving so much further ahead than we thought</strong><br />
</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know, what its like to fall in love with someone who&rsquo;s skin would make adversity wrap around your story and squeeze the life out of it</span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If judgment came knocking on our doors we would tell it, <i>there is no room for you here </i></span></p></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This mouth spews poetry that somehow always traces back to rapping,<br />
</span><span class="s1">I kid you not, the only rhythms flowing through this tongue is a mouth that has fallen for one too many words<br />
</span><span class="s1">I do not want to be seen for only this skin,</span></p><br />
<span class="s1">This skin,<br />
</span><span class="s1">Has always been a golden reflection of a radiance<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">I didn&rsquo;t know was already in my veins<br />
</span><span class="s1">This skin, has my Mother's face but her grandmothers tone<br />
</span><span class="s1">This skin smiles like her Father and verbally rambles like him too</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">This skin,<br />
</span><span class="s1">is creative and passionate<br />
</span><span class="s1">there are dreams tucked underneath each layer<br />
</span><span class="s1"><br />
</span><span class="s1">before you see anything,<br />
</span><span class="s1">I pray you see that<br />
</span><span class="s1">This smile,<br />
</span><span class="s1">This dimple,<br />
</span><span class="s1">These hands and how well they hold<br />
</span><span class="s1">This mouth and its love for words<br />
</span><span class="s1">We were not created to be just skin,<br />
</span><span class="s1">We are a collection of marvelous things<br />
</span><span class="s1">It would be a shame,<br />
</span><span class="s1">If all that you saw was only on the surface</span></h4></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Imagine </i>how much <em>you</em> would miss.</span></p></p>
