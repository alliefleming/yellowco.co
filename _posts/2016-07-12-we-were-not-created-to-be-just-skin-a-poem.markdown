<h4 class="p1"> <a href="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6086" src="http://yellowconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6.jpg" alt="lifestyle-photo-portfolio-6" width="700" height="500" /></a>This skin,<br />
  Has always been a golden reflection of a <em>radiance<br />
</em>  I didn&rsquo;t know was already in my veins </h4></p>
<p class="p1"> This skin, has my Mother's face but her grandmothers tone<br />
  This skin smiles like her Father and verbally rambles like him too<br />
 </p></p>
<p class="p1"> My siblings are all various shades of chocolate and caramel<br />
  We are the candy store; my great-grandmother always saw the sign<br />
  <strong>NO C O L O R E D S</strong><br />
 </p></p>
<p class="p1"> This world,<br />
  Has a dangerous way of reminding me who I am<br />
  Pulls history out of its pockets like a taunting reminder that this life I live,<br />
  Was not founded on ease<br />
 <strong> It is built on sacrifice and lives taken<br />
 </strong> <strong>Built on railroad tracks and Selma marches</strong><br />
 <strong> I am wondering, when will I start feeling my ancestors in my tongue<br />
 </strong> When will they start to speak on behalf in the midst of my occasional ignorance<br />
  When will they begin to start pumping in my heart too conditioned in living in the present?  </p></p>
<h4 class="p1"> I am wondering, when our world will stop backwards stumbling into a place coated in hate based off of how you look or how you love<br />
 </h4></p>
<h4 class="p1"> This skin, is not a threat<br />
  This love, is not a threat </h4></p>
<p class="p1"> My brother is many shades darker than me<br />
  He looks like all the little boys I keep seeing in twitter hash tags and on t-shirts<br />
  My brother is nine years old and already over five foot<br />
  Everyone, would see his skin as a threat<br />
  Until you know what it is like to cuddle his still small body in your hands<br />
  You will not see...<strong>that he is nothing like a threat</strong> </p></p>
<p class="p1"> I have friends, whose color in comparison to mine would be seen <strong>outrageous</strong> if we dared stepped&nbsp;  anywhere together<br />
  <strong>We are the reminders, that we are moving so much further ahead than we thought</strong><br />
 </p></p>
<p class="p1"> I know, what its like to fall in love with someone who&rsquo;s skin would make adversity wrap around your story and squeeze the life out of it </p></p>
<p class="p1"> If judgment came knocking on our doors we would tell it, <i>there is no room for you here </i> </p></p>
<p class="p1"> This mouth spews poetry that somehow always traces back to rapping,<br />
  I kid you not, the only rhythms flowing through this tongue is a mouth that has fallen for one too many words<br />
  I do not want to be seen for only this skin, </p><br />
 This skin,<br />
  Has always been a golden reflection of a radiance<br />
  I didn&rsquo;t know was already in my veins<br />
  This skin, has my Mother's face but her grandmothers tone<br />
  This skin smiles like her Father and verbally rambles like him too </p>
<h4 class="p1"> This skin,<br />
  is creative and passionate<br />
  there are dreams tucked underneath each layer<br />
  <br />
  before you see anything,<br />
  I pray you see that<br />
  This smile,<br />
  This dimple,<br />
  These hands and how well they hold<br />
  This mouth and its love for words<br />
  We were not created to be just skin,<br />
  We are a collection of marvelous things<br />
  It would be a shame,<br />
  If all that you saw was only on the surface </h4></p>
<p class="p1"> <i>Imagine </i>how much <em>you</em> would miss. </p></p>
