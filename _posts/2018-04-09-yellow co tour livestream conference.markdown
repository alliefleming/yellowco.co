[The Yellow Co. Tour](https://yellowcollective.lpages.co/yellow-west-coast-tour-2018/) is in full swing, and we're just coming off of our Orange County pop-up conference from Saturday! We had SUCH an incredible time meeting new faces, hearing from some truly inspiring women, and soaking in the goodness of our OC Community. We're headed to LA next this coming Saturday, and can't wait to see you there! If you haven't yet, grab your ticket here!

In case you missed it, we are SO excited to share that each entire event will be livestreamed (for FREE), so that everyone can be a part of each stop! Simply [head to this link](https://yellowco.co/live/) on the day of each event, grab a cup of coffee, and settle yourself in to hear some wisdom.

In addition to each stop being fully livestreamed, we've been sharing every detail (great and not-so-glamorous) in our [Tour Journal](http://www.yellowtour.co/)! Follow along with us [here](http://www.yellowtour.co/) up the coast with videos, reflections, and the (often equally beautiful and hilarious) musings of Joanna and Kacy! You can also catch all the details by following our [#theyellowcotour](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/theyellowcotour/) on Instagram!

Can't wait to see all you ladies and spend time with you in our cities! If you haven't grabbed a ticket yet for your tour stop, find all the details and [sign up here](https://yellowcollective.lpages.co/yellow-west-coast-tour-2018/)!
