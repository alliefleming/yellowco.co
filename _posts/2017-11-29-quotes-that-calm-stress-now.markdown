Someone once told me that there are four different types of people in this world — lifters, thrusters, weights, and drags. Lifters are people who lift you up when you spend time with them. You feel good about yourself when you leave that person. Thrusters are people who encourage you to be a better person. You are challenged to change when you leave that person. Weights are people who bring you down with the weight of his or her problems. You spend most of your time trying to fix their issues. And drags are people who bring you down to their level. You spend time commiserating with their victimhood, while being persuaded to dislike all the people, places, and things that bring "problems" into their life.

In some of my most difficult times, ironically, I have found myself surrounded by mostly weights and drags, and not enough lifters and thrusters in my life. I was missing very people who would tell me what I need to hear over what I want to hear, and support me along the way. When I find myself alone, and the people around me are not the most supportive, I've taken to internalizing and applying words of wisdom from others who've been down a similar path and turned their "lemons into lemonade".

These are some of my favorite quotes that have helped me adjust my perspective and transform difficult, stressful situations into an opportunity to lean into the present moment. They cause me to ask myself, "How can I use this situation to create good in the world, beginning with myself?"
