Hanna is a graphic designer and writer in Los Angeles, and the Communications
Director at Yellow Co. Any story well told--whether through design, words, art,
or food stirs her. As a romantic about nearly everything, she believes what we
bring to our world deserves to be beautiful. Her love is endlessly exploring new
ways to express our truest self, and has been trying to figure out her curls
since birth.
