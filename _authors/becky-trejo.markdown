Born and raised in Los Angeles, Becky lives in the city with her husband. For as long as she can remember, stories have been her passion. If she doesn’t have a pen or camera in hand, her favorite place to be is around a full table, buried in a good book, or lost on a backroad somewhere. She chases hard after joy and connection, but mostly, she’s just working on not being afraid of the dark anymore.
