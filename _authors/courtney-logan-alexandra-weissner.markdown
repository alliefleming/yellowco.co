Avid runners and enthusiastic foodies, Cortney Logan and Alexandra Weissner both co-founded bRUNch Running and its concept of "Run, Eat, Drink." Having a hunger for fitness, food, and fun, Cortney and Alex have created a community where other like-minded individuals can connect with one another in a unique way. bRUNch Running is a social community, a running and fitness community, a foodie community, but most importantly a non-intimating community that welcomes runners of all ages and abilities to join, also dubbed the "#bRUNchTribe".
