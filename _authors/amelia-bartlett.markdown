Amelia is a writer + entrepreneur living in the East Tennessee mountains. She writes primarily on paper and can often be found wandering in search of wildflowers. Her twelve year old self thought sheâ€™d have it all figured out by now, fortunately she's just getting started. Along the way, she's converting a school bus into a Slow Rolling Home with her partner and has her sights set on an unknown horizon.
