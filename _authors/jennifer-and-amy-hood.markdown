Jennifer Hood and Amy Hood are mildly tortured artists, twin sisters (telepathy not included in this model) and co-founders of Hoodzpah (a boutique brand identity and design agency based out of Newport Beach, CA). We got a chance to hear from them on the Orange County leg of our Ownership Tour. They spoke on how to find and share your unique brand voice. For those of you who couldn’t make it, they’ve distilled it into a blog below. The Hoods have worked on projects with exciting small businesses as well as with cultural pillars like Target, 20th Century Fox, ESPN, and Facebook. They’re also the authors of Freelance, and Business, and Stuff: A Guide for Creatives, a book dedicated to the ins and outs of starting, growing and running your freelance career or small business. The book includes advice from their own experience of starting Hoodzpah in 2011, worksheets to help readers get started already (a friendly kick in the pants), chapter opener posters that you can cut out to hang on your wall, and a dusting of unasked-for humor. You can grab it on their site here (hoodzpahdesign.com/shop).
