Jasmin is the digital marketer for Rebel.com and a freelance writer. Her background in journalism and public relations means she loves to write and often discusses the Oxford comma. She frequently wrestles with how many GIFs are too many to post on Twitter. Sheâ€™s currently working on her first book while simultaneously looking for ways to work classic quotes from The Simpsons into her everyday life.
