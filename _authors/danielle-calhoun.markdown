Wedding and humanitarian photographer, Danielle Calhoun, found herself living in two drastically polarizing worlds in 2014. Once of lavish excess, Pinterest praises and wastefulness, and the other full of great need, big purpose and huge opportunity, on humanitarian and aide trips across the world. She decided to use her passions for weddings and giving back and began an online wedding publication devoted to bringing awareness to other couples, vendors and brands that shared their passions for giving back, as well.
