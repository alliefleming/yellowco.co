Jackie is a lover of mindfulness, healing, and Trader Joeâ€™s dark chocolate. She
wrote Amazon bestseller, _[I Can't Believe I Dated Him](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Believe-Dated-Him-Knowing/dp/1683502809)_, to help women own
imperfections and embrace the true purpose of painful emotions. When she is not
coaching, she is exploring Los Angeles with her filmmaker husband Jake.
