Born and raised in foggy Northern California, Arielle Estoria Leda Wilburn is a Writer, Speaker and Creative. Through various aspects of storytelling: Spoken Word, Event Hosting, Acting and Voice Overs, Arielle orchestrates each art form out of a “Words not for the ears but for the soul” motto. This motto stems from her dedication to remind her audience that words are meant to be felt and not just heard, her ultimate purpose behind her work and in life is a diligent pursuit of instilling and reminding people of their worth through words. Arielle is the Co-Author of two self-published collections of poetry: Vagabonds and Zealots (2014) and Write Bloody Spill Pretty (2017) which can both be found on Amazon.com and in 2016, released her EP of poetry and music titled Symphony of a Lioness.
