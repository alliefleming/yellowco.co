A self-proclaimed dreamer, grammar geek, and storyteller with a serious case of wanderlust, Valeria can most often be found outdoors with her husband and golden retriever. Originally from Buenos Aires and raised in Miami Beach, she's fluent in Spanish, Malbec, and fútbol. Between the hours of 9 and 5, she is a communications consultant for travel brands. With a passion for writing, she’s now spreading her wings as a freelancer.
