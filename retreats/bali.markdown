  - question: Where will we be staying in Bali?
    answer: We will be staying in the beautiful Canggu neighborhood. Canggu is a dream--
      it's a chill area, but is near the international airport, the beach, and to
      some of the best destinations in Bali!
  - question: What are our accommodations like in Bali?
    answer: Our luxurious villa was designed by a famous French designer, and is a
      elegant take on cultural Balinese accommodations. Nine large bedrooms with luscious
      large bathrooms are situated within the villa, which has an open floor plan,
      a fully equipped kitchen, and large dining areas. The Villa itself is situated
      within tropical gardens. From the pool and jacuzzi you will have plenty of views
      of the rice fields that extend beyond the villa.
  - question: Are there single occupancy rooms?
    answer: All rooms are shared with one other female guest. Each room has two beds  (either
      two single beds or one queen and one single bed). Single occupancy rooms  typically
      aren't available but paid room upgrades to a single room may be made available
      closer to the retreat date if the there are last minute cancellations.
  - question: How many hours of workshops?
    answer: We have approximately 25 hours of formal coaching. Coaching will be scheduled
      to suit the weather. Many days we will be adventuring around in the morning,
      and will dive into our coaching in the afternoon during the afternoon rainy
      hour or so that accompanies this season.
  - question: How can I best prepare before the retreat?
    answer: Yes! We will be sending you docs to help your planning. You'll be able
      to work through some great questions that prepare you for the content covered
      by coaching.
  - question: Do I need a visa for Bali?
    answer: US citizens need a valid passport that will not expire within 6 months
      of the date of return from Bali to the US, as well as a visitors visa, which
      can be obtained in advance, or at the airport.
  - question: When is payment due?
    answer: Depending on the payment plan you choose and the number of registrants,
      payments can be made as late as early December, 2018.
  - question: What is the Early Bird pricing period?
    answer: August 23-September 20, 2018
  - question: Is there a minimum group number?
    answer: Yes. We operate a minimum of 7 guests per week. As we state in our Terms
      & Conditions, Yellow Co does reserve the right to cancel the retreat if the
      running of the trip is not deemed financially viable. In this situation you
      will be refunded all payments made to Yellow Co. with the exception of a couple
      fees that our ticketing service (Universe) may require.
  - question: Do I need travel insurance?
    answer: |-
      Yes! You are responsible for obtaining your own travel insurance cover. We recommend and require that you purchase travel insurance at the point of  booking your spot on a Yellow Co Retreat. We promise it’s a good idea— we require this is in order to make sure you are insured just in case unforeseen circumstances prevent you from attending the trip.

      We have heard great things about World Nomads. However, we recommend that you research travel insurance companies in your area and select an insurer that best fits what you need and are looking for.
  - question: Do you cater to dietary needs?
    answer: We can cater to dietary needs within reason! Once your place is booked
      we will send out a guest information form requesting information such as dietary
      requirements (if you say in the application you have specific diet needs). The
      chef at the villa is able to accommodate the majority of dietary requirements
      for meals we will have at our villa. Balinese food has lots of vegetarian and
      vegan options, so typically you will not find it difficult to find something
      you can't wait to bite into when we are exploring Bali!
  - question: What is the activity level?
    answer: We want you to get the very most out of our time together, and we have
      lots planned each day. However, the activities themselves are not physically
      draining.
  - question: Can I come alone?
    answer: 'Absolutely! The retreat is a wonderful opportunity to befriend kindred
      spirited women from around the world— prepare yourselves to make friends with
      a group that loves to travel as much as you do, and who wants to use work to
      impact the world for good! '
  - question: What do I need to bring?
    answer: Once you have signed up we will send you a list of things that we provide
      as well as items we recommend that you bring.
