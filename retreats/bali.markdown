  - question: Where will we be staying in Bali?
    answer: We will be staying in the beautiful Canggu neighborhood. Canggu is highly sought after as its location is nestled away in a quiet area, yet is very close to the international airport, to the beach, and to some of the most famous destinations in Bali!

    answer: Our luxurious villa was designed by a famous French designer, and is a elegant take on cultural Balinese accommodations. Nine large bedrooms with luscious large bathrooms are situated within the villa, which has an open floor plan, a fully equipped kitchen, and large dining areas. The Villa itself is situated within tropical gardens. From the pool and jacuzzi you will have plenty of views of the rice fields that extend beyond the villa.
  - question: Are there single occupancy rooms?
    answer: |-
      All rooms are shared occupancy with one other female guest. Each room has two beds, either two single beds or one queen and one single bed. We do not have single occupancy rooms available at the villa.

  - question: How many hours of workshops?
    answer: We have approximately 20+ hours of formal workshops. Workshops typically begin around 8am and we work though until lunch with some breaks in between.
  - question: Is there content prep I should do before the retreat?
    answer: Yes, we will send you a Blog Business Planning document to complete ahead of the retreat. The business planning document is to get you thinking about your business and blog before you arrive at the retreat.
  - question: Do I need a visa for Bali?
    answer: US citizens need a valid passport that will not expire within 6 months of the date of return from Bali to the US, as well as a visitors visa, which can be obtained in advance, or at the airport.

  - question: Do I need travel insurance?
    answer: |-
      Yes! You are responsible for obtaining your own travel insurance cover. We recommend and require that you purchase travel insurance at the point of  booking your spot on a Yellow Co Retreat. We promise it’s a good idea— we require this is in order to make sure you are insured just in case unforeseen circumstances prevent you from attending the trip.

      One great option is World Nomads. However, it is your responsibility to research travel insurance companies in your location and select an insurer that suits your needs and coverage requirements!
  - question: Do you cater to dietary needs?
    answer: We can cater to dietary needs within reason! Once your place is booked we will send out a guest information form requesting information such as dietary requirements. The chef will look to accommodate all dietary requirements for meals at the villa. Balinese food is has a large number of vegetarian and vegan options, so typically you will not find it difficult to find something scrumptious out and about in Bali!
  - question: What is the activity level?
    answer: We want you to get the very most out of our time together, and we do have a rather full itinerary. However, the activities themselves are not strenuous.
  - question: Can I come alone?
    answer: Absolutely! The retreat is a wonderful opportunity to befriend kindred spirited women from around the world— prepare yourselves to make friends with a group that loves to travel as much as you do, and who wants to use work to impact the world for good!
  - question: What do I need to bring?
    answer: Once you have booked your spot we will send you a list of suggested things to bring with you to the retreat, as well as whats available at the villa, such as hairdryers etc.
