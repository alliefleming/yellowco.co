short-description: A 1-day gathering for women who are working for the good of the
  world.
long-description: A gathering for entrepreneurial-minded women who are using their
  gifts, skills and talents to make the world a better place. Join us for our very
  first East Coast event where we will be exploring what it looks like to “create
  meaningful work”. We will be diving into the idea of work not being a career, but
  how we find and create meaning in this world. How can we create meaningful work
  in the world for good and encourage others around us to use their work for good?
  How can we use what we have to spread more love, kindness and goodness during these
  difficult times? We can’t wait to dive in!

  text: Tucked among five distinct Brooklyn neighborhoods – Gowanus, Carroll Gardens,
    Cobble Hill, Boreum Hill, and Park Slope – 501 Union has become a hub for the
    community to gather, celebrate, educate, and learn. The building dates back to
    1916 and once served as a classic car restoration shop. It was transformed into
    a private events venue in 2013 and now provides a unique backdrop for stylish
    weddings, corporate events, and photo shoots.
