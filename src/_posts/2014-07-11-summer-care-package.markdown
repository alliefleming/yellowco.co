Happy Friday ladies! Summer is well underway here in LA. This past week has been hot! The Yellow Conference is just a little over a month away and we are so excited!

Our mantra here is "spread goodness and bloom." So we put together and documented a summer care package meant for you to make and deliver to a friend who might need a pick me up, or that you just want to send some love. We have a recipe for Rosemary Cornbread and some ideas on how to gift it. It really is true that the more you give, the more you receive. We really had a blast with this shoot - everything from the brainstorming, the baking, to the shooting! Hope you enjoy!

Rosemary Cornbread  
TIME: 10 minutes prep, 30 mins baking time.  
Makes 2 (8” by 4”) loaves (one for your friend, one for you!)

Here's what you will need to make this goodness:  
Spray or butter (for greasing pans)  
2 cups flour  
1 cup sugar  
1 cup cornmeal  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary  
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt  
1/2 cup half and half  
2/3 cups whole milk  
2 large eggs  
1.5 stick (3/4 cup) butter, melted

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease two (8” by 4”) loaf pans, and set aside.

Whisk the dry ingredients (flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, salt & rosemary) together in a large bowl.

Whisk the wet ingredients (half and half, whole milk, eggs, melted butter) together in a different bowl. Take your wet ingredients, and slowly add them to the dry ingredients. Stir together until well blended.

Distribute the batter evenly into the two pans, place your rosemary on the top, and pop it in the oven! Bake until the bread is light brown around the edges and slightly cracking in the center- 30 to 35 minutes.

Cool 10 minutes in pans, then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely.

Voila! You have your bread! Now share the love and turn it into a gift for a friend.

There are many ways you can wrap this up for a friend- so get creative with it! Below is how we went about filling this bread with some extra love.

First off, start with a note. In our digital world, handwritten notes are less common. Taking the extra few minutes to handwrite a note says a lot.

PS- How adorable are these "XOXO" postcards from [Little Cat Design Co.?](http://www.littlecatdesigncoblog.com/) Love.

Next, grab a tea towel or some sort of cloth and swaddle your bread. (We used these affordable [kitchen towels from Target](http://www.target.com/p/room-essentials-kitchen-towels-4-pk-white/-/A-14441629)) Take some twine / string / whatever tying material you have, and wrap it around the cloth, securing it and making it look oh so pretty. Tuck your note into the string, decorate with pins, flowers, whatever you like! Take some extra rosemary and place it in with the bread.

Florals are all over the place in California in the summertime. We grabbed some wildflowers, wrapped them in black craft paper and personalized it. Pretty cute, right?

Next, grab some eating utensils, a blanket and some napkins and pack it up on your bike basket. This bread is about to be hand delivered. (If you don't have a bike, or if your friend lives a few freeways away, a car will do just fine!)

Food (especially food made by you) taste much better when eaten with friends. So after you've delivered your care package full of homemade goodness, pour some coffee, grab some honey butter and plates, serve and eat up!
