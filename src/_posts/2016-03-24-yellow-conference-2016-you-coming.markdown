Incase you missed it, we have added a [third day](http://yellowconference.com/conference/3-day-atmittance/) filled with just workshops this year. We decided to add this because we saw a desire from our attendees to get more practical application. Practical advice is hard to give in a keynote session.

So this year, you can get all the inspiration and good vibes from the 2-day conference, then head to the third workshop day on Saturday, and put it all into practice.

We will be releasing workshop titles and instructors in the next few weeks here! Keep an eye out.

We're looking forward to this being our best conference yet. Hope you come hang out with us this August!

_PS- if you're looking for hotels, Yellow attendees get a special deal at The Ace DTLA... Use code **YELLOW2016** over the phone or at checkout for a discounted room rate._
