In doing so, I have decided to only purchase clothing if I know it was made without slave labor. It has been a challenging but rewarding experience transitioning my closet to a totally conscious one. One thing I’ve learned throughout this process is that it takes time. And patience. And money. So one of the mantra’s I have adopted in my closet clean-out over the past two years is to _buy better not more._ That has served me well.

I get quite a few questions from women about how they can start their own transition to a more ethical closet. So as we start the new year, I thought I’d share some of my favorite core pieces and how I choose to add a piece to my closet.

## First of all, I don’t have a large, endless clothing budget, so I have to buy smart. When I make purchases I always ask myself these questions:

*   #### Will this dress/sweater/top/etc. bring me joy?

*   #### How versatile is it?

*   #### How do I care for it?

*   #### Can this piece transition from cooler weather to warmer weather?

*   #### Can I layer it and wear it different ways?

*   #### What is the fabric like?

*   #### Is it durable?

And most importantly:

*   #### How was it made?

*   #### Who made it?

*   #### Where did the fabric come from?

Cleaning out your closet is a long process. So give yourself patience!

Here are a few pieces that have been core for me in re-building my conscious closet. My hope is it will kickstart you on your own conscious closets journey and give you a good foundation from which to grow.

#### Jeans:

I love a good well made dark jean that can be worn a million different ways (T[he Paige Denim, Hoxton Ankle Peg Jeans in Barnett](http://www.paige.com/hoxton-ankle-peg-barnette/d/400003725C6930?CategoryId=253))

#### Black Pants:

Black pants are a must to change up your look and they can be fancy or casual depending on what you pair with it ([Imogene+Willie, Elizabeth Jean in Black](https://imogeneandwillie.com/elizabeth-black))

#### Cozy Sweater:

I’m all about kimonos and cardigans ([Elizabeth Suzann kimono](http://elizabethsuzann.com/collections/outerwear/products/jane-kimono?variant=5829770051)) ([Gap Cable Knit Cardigan](http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=8993&vid=1&pid=517240022))

#### Cool Dress:

Again, look for a dress that you can wear multiple ways, like over jeans, or a button down, or with a sweater or blazer ([Loup black dress](http://louponline.com/collections/dresses/products/black-gwen-dress))

#### A Good Button Down:

([Everlane white poplin](https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-tops/products/womens-poplin-long-sleeve-white)) Always a great easy piece to keep in your closet

#### Something with stripes:

([Everlane stripe boxy tee](https://www.everlane.com/collections/womens-all/products/womens-boxy-striped-black-white)) To keep you on trend

#### Cool Shoes:

([Modern Vice Blue Suede Handlers](http://www.modernvice.com/collections/handlers)) Because I dress very simply and monochromatic, I love a cool shoe. And the comfier the better.

They form the basis of my closet and most everything I purchase now works with these main items.

Lastly, if you are a fashionista on a budget, check out Tradesy.com or eBay for awesome finds at a much cheaper price. I do a lot of my conscious shopping at thrift stores. And lookout for sales! I got my modern vice booties (pictured above) for half price!

_I wish you all the best in 2016 and can’t wait to see the conscious closets transitions you make this year. Share them with me on social media at #consciousclosets.[
