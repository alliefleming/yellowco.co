Happy Monday friends! We are less than half way through with this Kickstarter and just over 20% funded. The way Kickstarter works is that if you don't raise ALL the money, you don't get ANY of the money. Sooo we need your help to make this happen! Here are a few ways to join us:

1- Head [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c) and click [BACK THIS PROJECT](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c)- it only takes a minute or two. (Every donation large and small makes us shed a tear of happiness, not joking..)

2- Spread the word! [Click here](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=help+build+a+space+where+women+can+connect+%26+learn+about+business%2C+life%2C+living+with+purpose%3A+http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1c4SkXu+&source=clicktotweet&related=clicktotweet) to Tweet about our campaign or simply copy and paste the text below to spread the word on Facebook or Instagram:
