Last Thursday was a night of radical, creative, community all over the **nation (and Canada!** So, can we officially say, "across the world?!")!From Orange County to LA, to Cincinnati, to Toronto(!!), we had creative women in tons of [locations](http://yellowconference.com/blog/page/3/) gather to encourage each other and have fun, and to tune in for our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c) Launch! For those unfamiliar or new to the Yellow Co. or our Kickstarter, we are hoping to raise **$57,000 **to develop an online hub called [The Yellow Room](http://theyellowroom.co/). This will be a space for women to connect and support each other, be empowered through mentorships and classes, and be equipped through a variety of resources in their area of growth and/or expertise. This is a huge dream, ladies, and we believe it will change the world for the good. **On Thursday alone we raised over $2,000. **We want to keep that momentum going throughout the entire month of April! We have **27 days **left to reach our goal, and if we don't reach our goal, we receive none of the funds for this project. **The Yellow Co. is so much more than a conference, and we want to invite you to be a part of this next step for our organization, that will impact generations of women to come. **

PLEASE: Spread the word of [our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1439745204/the-yellow-room-a-digital-hub-for-creative-world-c), use your sphere of influence to tell people about the good Yellow has done for you as you've been involved, and how others can join in the movement!
