_Need a last minute gift idea? How about one that you don't have to worry about the hands that made it for you? We know there's a lot of gift guides out there, but we've got the perfect line up of both beautiful and smart products that care about the people who made them as much as they care about the hands that will receive them. _

The Minimalist is a gal who knows her uniform. She’s too busy to hassle with trends and finds beauty in simplicity. She will love gifts that bring out her French Girl Classic style. _Tres Chic!_

The Activist is a woman on the go. From board rooms to fundraisers to trips to Africa, her first thought is always of others and the connection she has with humanity both near and far. Gifts that help her balance her busy life with relaxation are a must. Thought to how and where the gifts are made is priceless.

This gal is full throttle. She’s not afraid of prints and loves the trends. She makes a statement wherever she goes. Gifts that bring her boldness and unique voice are best.
