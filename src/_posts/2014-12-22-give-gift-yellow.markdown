Happy Christmas week ladies! Just wanted to drop in real quick to give you a quick reminder that today is the last day to grab your Yellow Conference ticket at the [Early Bird price](https://ti.to/yellowconference/yellow-conference-2015). Tomorrow the price will go up!

If you're still looking for the perfect gift for your bestie / wife / girlfriend / daughter / sister / creative friend, give her a ticket to The Yellow Conference. This not just giving her a gift, it's giving herÂ an experience that will have a life changing impact. A Yellow Conference ticket gift is telling your that person that you don't only believe in them, but you want to invest in them, their dreams and their future.

We made this little graphic for you to print out (or email) and give to the friend you are gifting to!
