It's that time again! Time for another Bloom Gathering. (If you'd like to see posts from past gatherings, [click here](http://yellowconference.com/?cat=41)). This month we will be enjoying a Sunday Spring Brunch together while being lead through some intentional conversation revolving around modern community. With social media allowing us to connect behind a screen, what does that mean for us today as relational beings? Come gather with us as we eat, converse, make new connections and get inspired.

[Grab your ticket here.](https://ti.to/yellowconference/march-bloom-gathering) (We have a limited amount of spots and sell out quick!)
