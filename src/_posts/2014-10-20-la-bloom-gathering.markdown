Last week we had our very first Bloom Gathering here in LA. 25 of us got together to make new friends, sip bubbly and nibble on yummy desserts. All while getting creative by decorating yellow balloons with encouraging thoughts, words and phrases.

After decorating the balloons, we headed outside and placed them all over the surrounding LA neighborhood. Our hope was that the people of LA would get up in the morning and be encouraged by the messages found on the balloons. A simple, fun way to bring some extra happiness to unsuspecting people.
