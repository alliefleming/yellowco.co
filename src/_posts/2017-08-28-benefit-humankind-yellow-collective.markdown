We are taking a quick rest over here after an inspiring, busy, and altogether _full_ week at [Yellow Conference 2017](http://yellowco.co/conference/)! If you were able to join us, in any capacity, we hope you left with full hearts and excited minds.

I know for many of us there is so much intake to process and ideas to flourish. But for now, let's sit for a moment, be present with ourselves, and reflect on all the goodness. Enjoy this video we launched at the conference along with the announcement of the [Yellow Collective](https://yellowcollective.co/) 2.0, made by the incredible [Marissa of Reel Rad Films](http://reelradfilms.com/)!
