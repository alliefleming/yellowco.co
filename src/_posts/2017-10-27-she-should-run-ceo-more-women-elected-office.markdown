Perhaps more than ever, we can see a dire need for unity, diversity, and genuine
collaboration in our nation's political offices.

While strides have been made towards women being further represented in elected
office, there is no doubt we still have a long way to go to close the gender
gap. [Erin Loos Cutraro](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/meet_the_staff), Founder
and CEO of [She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/), resolved to make this
gap much narrower. The non-partisan, non-profit organization she started has a
mission to grow the amount of women running for office in the US through both
community and multiple programs they offer. They dream to see women of all
political leanings, ethnicities, and backgrounds come together to support one
another and have equal opportunity to be leaders. Read more on how She Should
Run is changing the culture of women in politics in our interview with Erin!

#### **Can you share about the mission behind [She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/)?**

The mission of [She Should Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/) is to expand the
talent pool of women running for office in the United States by providing
community, resources, and growth opportunities for aspiring political leaders.
She Should Run is the first step; a place where women can feel inspired to run
for public office one day. Our
[Ask a Woman to Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/ask) tool provides a way for
individuals to tell us about great women leaders they know who should consider a
run for office.

Additionally, our first-of-its-kind
[She Should Run Incubator](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/Incubator) offers
resources and a community that meets women where they are in their paths to
elected leadership. We listen to our members and work with them to overcome
roadblocks that prevent them from running for office. The Incubator’s unique
approach focuses our members on why they want to run and the impact they’ll make
in elected office. And, we demystify resources available once women in our
community have made the decision to run.

#### **Your major goal is to have 250,000 women running for elected office by 2030\. Where are we at now in 2017, and what will it take to get there?**

Since the 2016 election, over 15,000 women have raised their hands and become
part of She Should Run’s programs. Our
[250k by 2030 campaign](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/take-action) outlines six
ways people can assist in increasing the number of women running for the nearly
500,000 elected offices in the United States by:

* Asking a woman in your life to run for office and telling her why you think
  she would be a great leader
* Offering to be a mentor to a woman who’s considering running for office
* Offering expertise if you have experience with campaigns/public office
* Organizing community training to inspire women to run
* Hosting a fundraiser to support She Should Run’s mission
* Donating to She Should Run to support the next generation of women leaders

### **It will take people from various backgrounds coming together to support women in their community to achieve this goal and close the gender gap in politics. **

#### **What do you believe are the main contributors to the gender gap in leadership and politics?**

Overall, many women do not feel that they are qualified or prepared to run for
office . There are many barriers that contribute to this confidence gap in their
qualifications, such as sexism or lack of access to resources and networks that
are critical for an effective campaign. For example, most local political
parties are headed by gatekeepers who, when ready to recruit candidates, will
recruit within their own inner circle which is typically comprised of other men.

Also, women are generally held to a higher standard, by themselves and others,
than men when it comes to leadership, and judged more harshly when it comes to
their looks or personal lives. Women are often expected to strike a balance
between proving they are competent enough for the job, but also still likable
enough.

#### **What are the main things that hold a woman who wants to run for office back?**

Women can underestimate themselves and experience quite a bit of imposter
syndrome; a pervasive feeling of doubt despite evidence to the contrary. They
will cite not having enough experience, or not feeling fully prepared to run for
office compared to their male counterparts who will wake up and decide to run
for office even if they are lacking credentials.

### **Often, women will not run for office until asked to by someone in their community who believes in them.**

Another aspect is the financial cost of running for office and serving in public
office. For example, legislators in New Mexico are provided no yearly salary and
a daily allowance of $164 for official expenses - meaning they have to find
alternative means of supporting themselves. This excludes candidates who are not
personally wealthy or flexible career wise, often women, from starting out on a
local level and moving up towards higher levels of office.

#### **I love that a driving force of your mission is to have women of _all_ political leanings, ethnicities, and backgrounds have an equal opportunity to lead in elected office. How have you seen women come together to support one another, despite their differences?**

One of the great things about being nonpartisan is that we can reach a diverse
group of women and encourage them to take the next step towards being
change-makers. A key component of our Incubator program is our community
element, where members can share their fears, dreams, hopes, and experiences
free of judgement. Many of the women in this online community are running for
political office themselves and are all of different backgrounds and beliefs,
but when they come to the group they find support no matter who they are. We see
women support each other every day there - sharing ideas, lending support and
championing each other regardless of any differences.

#### **Can you share more about how your programs work, and how you have seen their effects create change?**

[Ask A Woman to Run](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/ask_a_woman_to_run_for_office)
is an online tool where supporters can encourage a woman in their life to run
for office by telling her why she would be great in public office. We then
follow up with these women and offer them our e-book, weekly news-briefings
called The Warm Up, and invite her to join the
[She Should Run Incubator](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/incubator) . As mentioned
above, this is an important step in getting women to run.

When a woman signs up for the Incubator, they automatically have access to a set
of online courses that provides thoughtful guidance and gives context for what
matters most through the lens of public service. They are also given access to
an online community of women who are also in various stages of their path to
public office. Both the Ask A Woman to Run form and the Incubator have had a
positive impact on the number of women who are running for office.

### **Since the 2016 election, we have had over 15,000 women be inspired to run for office.**

Many of them have come from responding to the Ask A Woman to Run tool. Hundreds
of women have completed their online courses in the Incubator and are running
for all levels of office from city council to Congress.

#### **On November 6th, you are holding an event called the [National Conversation](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/national_conversation) to discuss the evolution of elected leadership and the issues among it. What can we expect to learn? How can we tune in if we are not in the DC area?**

[The National Conversation](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/national_conversation)
is a gathering of the women leaders from around the country to discuss how we
can move our mission forward. Speakers bring all political perspectives and
experiences to share with an audience of women, men, and girls who are eager to
move the mission further down the road, including 250KBY2030\. The audience will
learn how they can join the cause to be a part of the solution, so that our
country can move forward toward an evolution of gender parity in public
leadership. If you aren’t able to join us in person, don’t worry!
[Sign up to tune in via livestream](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/livestream2017?utm_campaign=171018_speakers&utm_medium=email&utm_source=sheshouldrun)
. We will also be posting a recording of our event online so that you can catch
up on a later date.

#### **Whether we ourselves want to run for office or not, what is one thing we can do today to get more women in elected office?**

If there is a woman in your community who you believe would be great in office,
[encourage her to consider running!](http://www.sheshouldrun.org/ask_a_woman_to_run_for_office)
Explain why you believe she would be a strong leader and what she could bring to
the table with her personal experiences and narrative. Many of us know a woman
who would be a great leader in their community; they just need that extra push.
