Bri is the community builder behind Oh Mama, Etc, a series of gatherings for the modern mama. Creating a safe and welcoming space for mamas to come together and talk about themselves and their lives instead of exchanging newborn sleep schedules and preschool enrollments. When she's not gathering mamas together for events or writing for her blog, she's playing with her 3 little ones at the beach or heading to a yoga class. Bri loves brussels sprouts, running and Target and hates balloons and birds.
