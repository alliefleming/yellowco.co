Lindsay is the co-founder and Chief Giving Officer of Society B â€” a charitable marketplace of goods that give back. She loves lattes, British music, and dance parties with her kids. Her actual favorite ethical good for fall is an Iowa State sweatshirt from 20 years ago that she still wears too often.
