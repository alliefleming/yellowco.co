Rachel is the Director of Stories for The Yellow Collective! When she's not working with Yellow, she manages Heritage Mercantile Co. in Costa Mesa and helps run a house-church out of her home in Whittier. She spends most of her time listening to the Moth podcast, reading memoirs, and trying to artfully merge humor and vulnerability.
