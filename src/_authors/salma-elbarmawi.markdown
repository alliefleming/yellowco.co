Salma is a writer, activist and aspiring social entrepreneur. She has a special love for culture, meaningful conversations, politics and dance. Although her passions for advocacy and articulate, authentic writing often collide with her love-hate relationship of the corporate world; she believes that one day, the narrative of business will change, and through the new generations' collective voice, the world will have no choice but to change with it.
