With a degree in social work and a love of words, Jill enjoys her job at FLDWRK where she develops content to inspire and equip people who want to advance the common good - in work and life. A firm believer that everything is better with coffee and people, you can often find her with a latte in hand and her three kids by her side as they explore Southern California on their homeschooling adventures.
