Creating a website to showcase what your true passion is can be a daunting task. There are so many items to think of when you are starting to put your pen to paper (or mouse to computer screen in this case). The difficulty is what should you focus on? What is most important and how can you highlight your vision properly? We put together a short list of what to keep in mind when you are building out your website. 
 
Eye catching imagery  
It’s important to have clear, high quality images that showcase your product and service to communicate your professionalism. Your brands personality and origin is delivered via the images the visitors see and it is all about creating a memorable first impression.  There are some great free image sites, such as Gratisography, that have high-resolution images.  
 E-commerce offerings
If you’re selling products, make sure your site is integrated to be a one-stop shop so customers don’t need to leave your page to make purchases. Create an inventory of your items, use integrated shipping and tax options, and use easy checkout options like Square or PayPal. You can also use features like coupon codes for loyalty or abandon cart emails to recapture visitors that may have not completed their purchase.
Strong headlines 
We believe that your homepage should also describe what you do and the purpose of your site in 15 words or less. This will capture the essence of your website. Use short and concise headers to help deliver a powerful and trusting message (and keeps your customers coming back for more).  Also consider the look of your headline - consider bright colors or a unique font to help grab attention. 
 Clear call to actions
How can your visitors gets in touch if they have questions about completing a sale? This should always highlight the underlying goal of your site. Adding a Contact Us form, an email address (or phone number) or a Buy Now button on your homepage can point your customers in the right direction.
Mobile apps
Make sure that you choose a Website builder where you can update your site from your phone or tablet. Managing your business is something you should be able to do on-the-go. If your store is closed due to a holiday, you need to fulfill orders, communicate with customers that have questions or you just want to see your website traffic, you should be able to. 
 
 
 
The best part of building a website is that you get to express yourself and give people the ability to experience your talent and knowledge.  Your passions and what you believe in are ultimately what will power the best experience.  We hope these techniques help make it possible for the best of you to shine through!
