PRIVILEDGE : Podcasts
 
I’m just going to come out and say it, hoping it’s never been said before. Podcast bingeing is the new Netflix bingeing. Am I right?! Can I get some praise hand emojis?!
 
The world of Podcasting is becoming vast and varied, all the better to feed our new addictions. I personally love taking note of how each podcast has different little editing features, which keeps things interesting. There are so many ways to consume information, but listening to people talk their talk has a way of helping us connect much deeper than a blog or book would.
 
As the world morphs into more and more of a place where the access to information is infinite, we’re too easily forgetting that all of these varied perspectives and passions were once hidden behind closed doors. I love the glimpse into niche places that Podcasts give us, and the characters you find there.
 
I’ve gathered five cool and unique podcasts that I think the Yellow lady would find fun to explore.
 
 
1.     The Moth: these are real stories, always told live, that are put out into the world to help us connect better. This podcast is about empathy for the human condition fostered via the age old craft of telling a story, bringing us all closer together in the end.  
 
2.     Humanosphere: the tagline for this podcast is, “Give a damn: News and analysis of the fight against inequity.” Need I say more? Great outlet for learning about some tough issues.
 
3.     Armchair Expert: this is from our friend Dax Shepard, and I fell in love with this Podcast by listening to him and his wife, Kristen Bell, talk about life. It’s the one celebrity podcast I’ve added, since it’s real, but also funny, and delivers much more depth than you would think.
 
4.     Being Boss: I am addicted to this podcast. I’ve been following for years as these two creative entrepreneur femme fatale’s keep us all motivated, educated, and being the boss of our own lives.
 
5.     On Being: this podcast is about the human experience and explores a lot of life’s big questions from the perspective of people all around the world, on totally varying subjects that all tie back into how we live our lives.
