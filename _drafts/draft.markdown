How many ways have you heard the word “no”? What about, “don’t touch that,” or “you can’t do that” or “there’s no way.” Has anyone told you to believe in yourself, that you have potential, or that you must step out of your comfort zone? Which words held more weight? 

As inspiring as the latter phrases truly are, often times, like a stick of juicy fruit gum, they seems to lack longevity. Why is it that it feels more natural to stop when someone tells you to, rather than to go when they’re begging you? 

I believe courage is a seed, one that grows from within but is often planted from without. Truthfully, for some of us, it's not enough to know we can. We have to feel that the people who love us believe we can too. We want to know that those with our best interests also think we’ll succeed if we take a chance. We want to know that in their eyes, failure isn’t a possible outcome for us. And yet, certainty seems to be everyone's prerequisite of your likelihood to succeed. 

Isn’t that the catch 22 of living your best life? That you can never know for fact that it will be. 

In life, we make plans. We push boundaries. We play it safe. We take risks. We live honorable lives that our parents would be proud of. And yet, no matter what decisions we've made, no matter what choices we chose or pathways we've walked, we're the only ones who ever have to live with our decisions. 

Then, why is it that so often we allow others to make them for us? 

The simple truth of life is that we will all stare failure in the face more than once. We will all fall apart. We will all lose someone we love, make mistakes we regret and give up on dreams we wish we hadn't. The beauty of life is that as long as your breathing, you have the capacity to mess up, fall apart and start all over. 

We were brought on this earth for such a short span of time, none of us certain of the future, none of us able to predict the outcome of our choices. All of us wanting to leave this place, knowing we made an impact that was greater than ourselves. 

If you're wondering if your plan will work, if you're wondering if you can find a way to travel the world, if you're wondering if you'll ever meet the love of your life, land the job you’re not quite qualified for, write the book, build the company... the answer is, you'll never know unless you try – and neither will they. 

I didn't find the confidence to overcome the "you shouldn't do that talk," I didn't just wake up one morning and feel resistant to the "you should be responsible" advice. I spent long thoughtful hours wondering what I'd do if I didn't go. How I'd live with my decision to play it safe, if I felt I was making it for someone else. How I'd feel if I found out someone else I knew did it first, risked it all, while I was stuck in the same place – all at the fault of my own. 

I decided, instead of wondering if I would succeed, to throw all of my emotional energy into figuring out what I'd do if/when I failed. 

Because leaving the stability of a steady income, comfort of a loving home and the city that I was raised wasn't an easy decision. The extravagance of it all tends to overshadow the practical elements. But traveling has been a burning desire in the pit of my soul for as long as I can remember. For me, uncertainty is a slippery slope to anxiety. For me there's value in consistency. And yet, for me, two weeks in a single foreign place would never be enough. 

The world has always be a marvel I’ve been dying to see, and life seems so much shorter the longer I've lived it. So, my only choice was to take ownership of my choice. It’s about realizing that the naysayers could be right… but they also could be wrong. It’s about believing that you’re meant for something more, because feeling like your days are on repeat can kill you too. 

It’s about committing to your truth. Knowing that you don’t have to be certain. Knowing that, when they ask you what ‘happens if this or that,’ you’re allowed to say you don’t know, or “what happens if it doesn’t” or even, “I’ll figure it out.” The only answer anyone is looking for, is your own vote of confidence. The only response they need is your assurance. The only person capable of holding you back is you. 

The money will come. The job listings will continue to be posted. The work will eventually get done. But your time, will never come back.
