As the year winds down, it’s time to start looking forward to what 2019 has in store. In terms of wellness trends, it’s fun to take a look at what’s happening in the world, where we’ve been and where we’re headed. While the next big thing might still be underwraps, you’ll definitely be seeing these 6 trends popping up everywhere in 2019.

#### CBD and Hemp Products 

You’ve by now heard about CBD oil, a huge trend in wellness already (and if not you can read all about it [here](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/10/22/cbd-oil-what-to-look-for/)) but in 2019 we’re going to be seeing a whole lot more products from the cannabis plant. Beauty products containing CBD are already popping up at places like [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/product/high-cbd-formula-body-lotion-P438374) touting the anti-inflammatory components and muscle relief from cannabis coupled with what you’ve come to expect from your lotions and soaps. Keep a look out for CBD and cannabis drinks like infused coffees and cocktails as well as chocolates and even treats for your dogs.

#### Adaptogens 

You may have seen your favorite trendy wellness Instagrammers talk about tossing 15 different adaptogens in their smoothies and wonder ‘what the heck is this stuff?’ - well in 2019 you’ll likely see a lot more of it. Adaptogens are basically a handful of different ancient or traditional medicines that are safe and used for balancing hormones. Most come in a powder form that you can easily add to smoothies, coffees, etc. Popular adaptogens are rhodiola, ashwagandha, and maca and they help with everything from stress to sleep to sex drive. 

#### More vegan options from your local grocer 

Plant based eating is definitely on the rise and big brands and established companies are starting to take notice. You can now get far vegan options at your local grocer than ever before with new vegan or plant based brands popping up at a rapid pace. There’s already a plethora of dairy-free milk alternatives available, but you’ll also find more options in the canned food aisle with brands like Hormel and Progresso offering vegan options as well as specifically plant-based companies like [Daiya](https://daiyafoods.com/), [Beyond Meat](https://beyondmeat.com/), and [Gardein](https://www.gardein.com/) lining the shelves of large chain grocery stores around the country. 

#### Probiotic + Fermented Foods 

The probiotic and fermented food trend is two-fold: people are looking for ways to cut out additives and preservatives and eat ‘cleaner’ while at the same time looking for anti-inflammatory and healthy foods. Fermentation allows for foods to be preserved naturally and have amazing health benefits to go with it. Look for things like kimchi, kombucha, kefir, and sauerkraut to get your fermented food fix.

#### No-waste households 

Another trend that’s hot on Instagram and about to catch like wildfire is the idea of a no-waste household or plastic-free home. With minimalism fully covered in the last few years, we’re taking it a step further and going minimal on our waste as well. Many small businesses ship orders in recyclable and minimal packaging, entire states are outlawing plastic shopping bags, and things like reusable beeswax  wrappers are being swapped for tin foil and plastic wrap to keep leftovers fresh. 

#### Mushroom everything  

Like adaptogens, mushrooms and mushroom products are about to be huge. You’ve probably seen or tried mushroom coffee but in 2019 expect to see mushroom chocolate, broths and even personal care products like soaps and shampoos. The mushroom market is expected to exceed $50 billion in the next 6 years according to [Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/mushroom-market) so it’s definitely a trend that’s only getting bigger.

It’s safe to say that in 2019 there will be no shortage of trendy wellness products. Take your pick and try a few on for size. Whether you’re looking to try something brand new (mushroom coffee?) or maybe take a walk on the meatless side for a few days in 2019, there’s a lot to look forward to with wellness in the new year.
