Here at Yellow, we’re always looking for new ways to better equip our community with the practical tools and resources they need to make an impact for good on the world. We’re also always asking ourselves, “How can we make Yellow our dream job?” Because working is so much more fun when you have a chance to dream, scheme, and do what you love. 

Our [Bali Retreat](https://yellowco.co/retreats/bali/) was created through brainstorming ways we could better help and serve our community, while also having a blast! “What if we took a group of people to Bali to get away and out of their normal routine, learn about growing and scaling their do-good business, all while staying in a beautiful villa and going on adventures?” It’s a no brainer. YES.

So, ladies, that’s what we’re doing. In February 2019 we are headed to Bali to dive into so much more than the coral reef filled water ;).

##### Lead by [31 Bits](https://31bits.com/) social enterprise founder, Jessie Simonson, and myself, Joanna, founder of Yellow Co., we'll spend the week jumping into the coaching, tools, knowledge, resources, and community you need to start, build, or scale your do-good business – all while growing new friendships with like-minded women and adventuring through the beautiful island of Bali.

We will be staying in a beautiful villa in Canggu – an area favored for its relaxed atmosphere among the rice fields, and proximity to Bali’s most famous beaches. Complete with a pool, jacuzzi, tropical garden, and views of the rice fields, our villa is the perfect space to get away and focus on yourself and your business.

##### [Our goal with this retreat is to help you move from the beginning phases of your do-good business to a developed business plan with clear next steps on how to grow and scale your social enterprise, while on a beautiful island with a group of like minded women to support and cheer you on.](https://yellowco.co/retreats/bali/) 

We want to help you move from side-gig to full time business owner, because we believe in YOU. Your business needs to get out into the world and start impacting the world for good!

The curriculum we’ll be going through will be surrounding these topics, depending on the needs and unique problems the group is facing:

- Understanding the root problems facing your customers and articulating your “Why” 
- Developing dream, mission, and vision statements to guide your organizational strategy
- Creating a brand persona to target a specific customer segment
- Marketing Strategy & PR 101 
- Developing a pricing structure for your product or service 
- Building a comprehensive business model around your minimum viable product (MVP)
- Beginning to model business financials to assess short-term and long-term viability 
- Creating a company playbook to guide your daily/weekly activities 
- Various budget hacks & tricks of the trade 
- Developing a post-retreat game plan that includes “next steps”

You’ll walk away with a plan and a step by step guide of the actions you’ll take when you’re back home in the thick of running your business!
