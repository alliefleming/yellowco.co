We are just two months out from our [5th annual Yellow Conference](https://yellowco.co/conference/), and our team is bursting with excitement getting everything ready for all of you incredible ladies that will be joining us! If you haven't made it to one yet - these two days are so much more than a typical conference. This is for the ones who desire to fight for a better tomorrow. The ones who are willing to roll up their sleeves, step out in courage, and use their creativity for good. This is where we come together for the benefit of humankind.

This year our 2018 theme is [“Our Ownership”](https://yellowco.co/conference/). It’s no secret millennials aren’t owning items like cars, houses and music like previous generations. Although we are less inclined to own when it comes to material possessions, what if we were known as a generation who knows how to own who they are? Owning the stories, dreams, visions, passions and abilities we have. Owning the problems of the world instead of turning a blind eye. Owning the fact that we’re in this together as global citizens. 

In addition to the amazing community of 500 creative, entrepreneurial-minded women gathering together, interactive experiences, and a whole marketplace of do-good businesses, we will, of course, be hearing from some powerhouse speakers! We're so excited to announce a few of them to you today, and to hear from them on how taking ownership has influenced their lives!

What was a powerful moment in your life when you took ownership over something? 

"One late night while living in Ethiopia, I was driving home and saw a young woman standing out in the dark waiting. It was clear she was working in prostitution, but rather than seeing her as just another woman on the streets, I saw my young daughter in that little girl. Something that night raged in my heart, something I was already passionate about fighting for became even more important to me. When I saw my little girl in the eyes of this young woman, I knew that this was what I was called to live for, that is why we started Parker Clay."

#### Allison Fallon  
Author & writer

What was a powerful moment in your life when you took ownership over something? 

"When I wrote the first draft of my book, I promised myself I’d tell the whole truth of my abusive marriage—and I did. The problem was, it wasn’t until I started reading the words on the page that I realized how much I was blaming and passing the responsibility for my life off to someone else. In the second draft, I made it a point to take responsibility for creating the life I wanted to live—examining my attitudes, mindsets, and choices and looking at how they played a role in the miserable position I was in. Writing that second draft was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but also the best. It showed me how much power I had—using my words—to create a life that was full of joy and meaning and love."
