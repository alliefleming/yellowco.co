Co-founders of Parker Clay

What was a powerful moment in your life when you took ownership over something? 

"One late night while living in Ethiopia, I was driving home and saw a young woman standing out in the dark waiting. It was clear she was working in prostitution, but rather than seeing her as just another woman on the streets, I saw my young daughter in that little girl. Something that night raged in my heart, something I was already passionate about fighting for became even more important to me. When I saw my little girl in the eyes of this young woman, I knew that this was what I was called to live for, that is why we started Parker Clay."

#### Allison Fallon  
Author & writer

What was a powerful moment in your life when you took ownership over something? 

"When I wrote the first draft of my book, I promised myself I’d tell the whole truth of my abusive marriage—and I did. The problem was, it wasn’t until I started reading the words on the page that I realized how much I was blaming and passing the responsibility for my life off to someone else. In the second draft, I made it a point to take responsibility for creating the life I wanted to live—examining my attitudes, mindsets, and choices and looking at how they played a role in the miserable position I was in. Writing that second draft was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but also the best. It showed me how much power I had—using my words—to create a life that was full of joy and meaning and love."
