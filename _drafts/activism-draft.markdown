We often wonder why the world is filled with so much suffering. Why innocent people become targets of violence, or children are taken from us too soon. We often wonder why prejudice is perpetuated or injustice carried out. Following every notion of inequity, violations, or oppression, a seed of resistance is planted so deep within our souls waiting for it's time to rise. The fortune of so many obstacles in this world is that there is enough room for every human being to become an advocate against suffering that raises the voice buried in their soul. 

Your voice is not something to be found. She has existed within you from the very first moment you felt the outrage of hurt. Sheâ€™s been whispering her words since your body's first interaction with intolerance. Since your spirit's first feeling of wreckage by heartbreak. Since your eyes first witnessed the agony of a homeless child's hunger. Your voice has been writing on the wall since before you knew how to read. 

Discovering what you care about, what your heart yearns for, is tied ever so paradoxically between your pain and your passion. 

### What moments have moved your soul in a way that has re-shaped the world you've always seen? 

What markers in your life will you always look back on as the time of change in the woman you were? 

Those markers can be as profound as World War I was for Crystal Eastman. At the time a lawyer, journalist, and social advocate, she lead in the fight for women's suffrage, and her long-standing beliefs in equality for all eventually led her to co-found the National Civil Liberties Bureau, now the ACLU. 

These events can also be as drawn out as the publishing of Rupi Kaur's first book, _Milk and Honey_; a collection of poetry about survival and the experiences of violence, abuse, love, and loss. A book which was conceived years after her middle school essays, being bullied by nasty teens, and the rejection from so many publishers and magazines who didn't believe in her vision. 

If your voice is too afraid to speak, you must start by swearing to believe in her. To support her. To love her even at the expense of standing with her alone. 

The most qualitative assurance you'll have in building the courage to breathe your truth is to make an unbreakable pact: that you won't feel guilty for pushing your vision. That you won't allow the world to tune the chords of your voice to the way they're comfortable hearing it. That when you shake, because it's hard and tiresome, you do it in the confines of the people who support you, rather than in the arms of those who promise you a path at the expense of your vision. 

Once you've determined what your energy for activism will fuel, take these steps to move forward in using your voice for good.

#### Educate Yourself 

Whether your goal is to educate others or fight for a cause, knowledge is power. While you don't have to be Black to advocate for [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/), and you don't have to be an immigrant to defend [DACA](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/05/548754723/5-things-you-should-know-about-daca), you do have to understand what you're talking about. You must learn from the perspectives of those whose lives are affected by the cause, even if one of those lives is yours.   

#### Show Up 

Chances are, you aren't the only human who is fighting for the cause, and that's a great thing! Part of encouraging a movement is understanding what motivates you to show up. Whether it's collecting signatures, raising awareness, or protesting on a Saturday afternoon, figure out why certain events trigger a feeling of community and power within you. Then, look for opportunities put your motivation to work. This could look like planning or attending a [social justice meet up](https://www.meetup.com/topics/social-justice/), or joining a local chapter of a national cause. 

#### Share the Wealth of Information

Now that you've taken the time to educate yourself, asses your beliefs, and possibly unlearn some of your own bad habits, it's time to share your experiences and resources. Despite angry rants and less-than-pleasant arguments on Facebook and Twitter, [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/25/the-tone-of-social-media-discussions-around-politics/) recently found that 1 in 5 social media users saw something on social media that changed their mind about a political issue or candidate. It may feel a little draining at times, but your words matter. There are ears open specifically to your voice, ears that others can't get to. That power is spectacular and can be used for change you never thought possible. 

#### Take Action 

You are your most powerful force, and yet as you've probably felt anytime you've tried something new, starting is the hardest part. But there are plenty of ways to take action as a first step to using your voice. You can contact your local government representatives if your motives are political. You can volunteer your time if your motives are more social. You can donate to organizations at home or abroad if your motives are more economical, and turn your spare cash into an opportunity to create immense impact.  

No matter what you do, no matter how many steps it takes, or how long you're at it before you ever feel any momentum, remember that you are an activist by advocating for yourself first. There was a space carved out in this world that only you fit. Remember that when your voice trails, when it feels like too much, or when the fear is holding you back. You were given a voice because you were meant to speak, so speak, and let your heart find the right words to guide you.
