Reposessing Your Voice and Using it To Make Change

We often wonder why the world is filled with so much suffering. Why innocent people become targets of violence, or children are taken from us too soon. We often wonder why prejudice is perpetuated or injustice carried out. 

Yet, following every notion of inequity, violations or oppression, a seed of resistance is planted so deep within our souls waiting for it's time to rise. 

The fortune of so many obstacles in this world is that there is enough room, enough obstruction, for every human being to become an advocate against a suffering that raises the voice buried in their soul. 

Your voice is not something to be found. She has existed within you from the very first moment you felt the outrage of hurt. Sheâ€™s been whispering her words since your body's first interaction with intolerance. Since your spirit's first feeling of wreckage by heartbreak. Since your eyes first witnessed the agony of a homeless child's hunger.  

Your voice has been writing on the wall since before you knew how to read. 

Discovering what you care about, what your heart yearns for, is tied ever so paradoxically between your pain and your passion. What moments have moved your soul in a way that has re-shaped the world you've always seen? What markers in your life will you always look back on as the time of change in the woman you once were? 

Those markers can be as profound as World War I was for Crystal Eastman. At the time a lawyer, journalist and social advocate, she lead in the fight for woman's suffrage, and her long standing beliefs in equality for all, eventually led her to co-found the National Civil Liberties Bureau, now the ACLU. 

Those markers can also be as drawn out as the publishing of Rupi Kaur's first book, Milk and Honey, a poetry book about survival and the experiences of violence, abuse and love and loss. A book which was conceived years after her middle school essays, being bullied by nasty teens, and the rejection from so many publishers and magazines who didn't believe in her vision. 

For the voice that is afraid to speak, you must start by swearing to believe in her. To support her. To love her even at the expense of standing with her alone. 

The most qualitative assurance you'll have in building the courage to breathe your truth is if you make an unbreakable pact: that you won't feel guilty for pushing your vision. That you won't allow the world to tune the chords of your voice to the way they're comfortable hearing it. That when you shake, because it's hard and tiresome, you do it in the confines of the people who support you, rather than in the arms of those who promise you a path at the expense of your vision. 

There are tangible steps you can take, some that you must take, once you've determined what your energy for activism will fuel. 

Educate Yourself 

Whether your goal is to educate others or fight for a cause, knowledge is power. 

You don't have to be black to advocate for Black Lives Matter, you don't have to be an immigrant to defend DACA, but you do have to understand what you're talking about and learn from the perspectives of others whose lives are affected by it, EVEN if one of those lives is yours.   

Show Up 

Chances are, you aren't the only human who's fighting for the cause, and that's a great thing! Part of encouraging a movement is understanding what motivates you to show up. Whether it's collecting signatures, raising awareness, or protesting on a Saturday afternoon, figure out why certain events trigger a feeling of community and power within you and how you can emulate those same qualities in movements of your own. Planning or attending a social justice event in your backyard can be as easy as joining a meet up or finding a local chapter for a national cause. 

Share the Wealth of Information

You've taken the time to educate yourself, asses your beliefs and unlearn some of your own bad habits, now it's time to share your experiences and resources. 

Despite angry rants and less than pleasant arguments on Facebook and Twitter, Pew Research center recently found that 1 in 5 social media users saw something on social media and changed their minds about a political issue or candidate. 

It may feel a little draining at times, but your words matter. There are ears open specifically for your voice, ears that others can't get to. That power is spectacular and can be used for change you never thought possible. 

Take Action 

You are your most powerful force, and yet as you've probably felt if you've ever tried a new diet, starting is the hardest part. 

There are plenty of ways to take action that will contribute to the credibility of your voice. You can Contact your local government representatives if your motives are political. You can volunteer your time if your motives are more social. You can donate to organizations at home or abroad if your motives are more economical, and turn your spare cash into an opportunity to create immense impact. You can even make a video if your passion is something that must be seen to be felt. 

No matter what you do, no matter what words you use to push your movement forward. No matter how many steps it takes, or how long you're at it before you ever feel any momentum, remember that you are an activist because you advocate for yourself first. There was a space carved out in this world that only you fit. Remember that when your voice trails, remember that when it feels like too much, remember that when the fear or shame is holding you back. 

You were given a voice because you were meant to speak, so speak, and let your heart find the right words to guide you.
