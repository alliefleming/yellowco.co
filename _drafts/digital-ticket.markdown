YELLOW CONFERENCE DIGITAL PASS: NOW ON SALE

### 500 women, 9 speakers, and an electricity of courage, creativity, and fighting for a better tomorrow.

It's all happening next week. But - if you don’t have the time, money, or resources this year to get to The 2018 Yellow Conference in person, you’re in luck. We’ve just released a Digital Pass ticket for you! And trust us, you'll feel that same electricity buzzing from your screen.

The Digital Pass includes access to our 2-day conference including 8 full length speaker sessions, 2 panels, and exclusive announcements, early access, and early ticket prices to some brand new, exciting experiences we have coming up in 2019! It’s over 12 hours of content- cue that confetti.

By signing up, you'll get a link to all of the conference footage by Sunday, August 26th. And not only can you sit through all the goodness once, but you over and over again whenever you want! 

A few ways we recommend soaking up the Digital Pass best:

###### 1. In your PJs. 

Grab a glass of rosé and throw on your comfiest pants. Open up that laptop and get ready to get INSPIRED! 

###### 2. Host a screening with your best girlfriends. 

Invite your friends over to your place and host a screening of the conference together! Might as well turn it into a potluck while you're at it :). 

###### 3. Watch with your work crew. 

Do you belong to a networking group? A [Yellow Collective](https://yellowco.co/membership/) chapter? Or have really amazing co-workers? Grab your work friends and take time to watch the speaker sessions together. There’s so much to gain and learn from these speakers about your work, so what better place to share the experience than with those who support it daily!

Most importantly, have FUN! It can be tempting to feel as though exciting things only happen in big cities like Los Angeles. Being the digital people that we are, we see everything that’s going on at all times, and it can cause some major FOMO. BUT, one of the great things about the digital space is it also allows you to participate from wherever you are! This is a chance for us to work together for the good of the world – regardless of distance or location. How will _you_ be joining in?
