If you could rewind the story of my life to one year ago today, you would see me sitting in a remarkably similar position to the one I am in right now. I would be in my old bedroom at my parent’s house, thinking about the year ahead and wondering how community would play a part in it. One year ago today, I had no idea that in the following months I would be packing up my life for what felt like the millionth time, and moving across the country to re-plant roots in Southern California. Roots that, it turns out, would grow and bear the fruit of community not only myself, but for the [Yellow Community](https://yellowco.co/membership/) at large.

I didn’t know a year ago today that my “yes-es” would lead to becoming the Director of Operations for Yellow Co.

### But as I sat and thought about what 2017 might bring, I hoped that it would bring opportunities to build with people, instead of at a distance from them.

One year ago today, I didn’t know that my experiences with community and moving and loneliness would bring me to kicking off 2018 by planning a [Yellow Collective](https://yellowco.co/membership/) West Coast Tour, but here I am!

As the daughter of an international pilot who was raised on a houseboat on the Amazon river in Brazil before leaving home and family in 4th grade for the United States, my upbringing was unique. Some of my earliest memories are of airports and faraway places I was fortunate enough to explore as a child. My parents' value of independence allowed me many unique experiences — from leaving my family to spend a summer in a remote Ecuadorian village as a 13 year old, to skipping school to join my father on spontaneous international trips, to memories of summers spent in exotic places — I grew up loving the adventures my parents' life gave me access to. As I grew, I gravitated to patterns that allowed me to live and work independently, even while I found myself longing for community.

### My passion for travel and independence became equally matched by my passion for deep roots — three things which felt constantly at war.

As I went off to college, studied abroad in Europe, moved from the mid-west, to the West Coast, to Hawaii, to Asia, to Texas, and then back to the West Coast, I began to experience the darker side to my beloved independence. Isolation, disconnection, and a sense of learned aloofness were never far away. The older I got, the more opportunities emerged to go new places, meet new people and experience new things. By the time I was 24, I realized that my life would constantly be a balancing act between when to say “yes” to going somewhere new, versus when to say “yes” to staying and growing with the people and opportunities I already had in my life.

I hoped that eventually I would find a way to take my gifts and skills and put them to use towards something that could combat the isolation and alone-ness that seem to be an inescapable sidekick — not only in my life, but seemingly to every member of our ultra-connected generation. I began to see how I was by no means the only person experiencing isolation. It wasn’t even only people who lived a transient lifestyle — it was everyone; despite our ability to stay connected with people 24/7, regardless of the oceans between us. Everyone is lonely, and everyone wants community on some level. Sometimes, I have seen it manifest in a healthy way, with people wanting to know others and be deeply known in return. Sometimes, I have seen it manifest more dysfunctionally, with people being so terrified of the prospect of being alone with themselves, that they cling to anyone or anything that will keep solitude at bay.

As 2017 unfolded and I had the opportunity to pursue my dream of building community within community, I was ironically pulled back into more loneliness than I had felt in my adult life as I experienced my 10th move within nine years. Perhaps it was so much harder for me this time because everything was being built all at once — my friendships, my job, my daily routine. It was all being created from scratch, with no area more stable to lean on when my new constructions felt shaky. All my foundations were being poured at the same time, and as I struggled to balance without falling, I found that this experience was shaking things up inside of me.

### For the first time, I pursued community with intentions that weren’t healthy, and were more of an avoidance tactic so that I could make a cross-country move without facing the inconvenient and uncomfortable phase of getting used to being alone again.

Learning a new version of my old balancing act is hard, and I’m still figuring it out. But as I look back, I realize that over the years life has given me a unique seat to observe the multi-faceted relationship between community and isolation from many different perspectives. From the perspective of someone who simply wanted to be known and know the people who crossed her path. From the perspective of someone who was a stranger to herself and who leapt headfirst into community as a way to avoid learning how to like herself. From the perspective of the person so far away from community that she stopped looking for it and was surprised when it happened again. And from the perspective of someone who began to “meet” herself again as she introduced herself to others. [The Yellow Collective](https://yellowco.co/membership/) was a big part of why and how I was able to find balance and start pursuing community again from a place of first being comfortable with isolation.

There have been seasons of my life where I felt loneliness was a decidedly bad thing. Now, I think that to be alive is to experience loneliness, and that reality is not one that should scare us. When loneliness is your teacher, you feel the rough edges of your own mind and soul, and you learn how to accept them and love them (because who else is there to love?). You stop being lonely because you become friends with yourself.

### When people who have learned to be friends with themselves join together to form community it’s a force to behold. That is what I have witnessed among the Yellow Collective.

I have experienced firsthand how life-giving it is when you surround yourself with women who know themselves and have befriended themselves before befriending you. They carry an awareness of what they are capable of individually, but see past that to what we are capable of collectively.

They don’t pursue community with each other to avoid themselves, or as a bandaid for each others wounds — but rather to bring their strength together to acknowledge the wounds that we, as humans, always have, and to push forward and make something beautiful from them. They have the purpose of lifting each other up and impacting the world for good with their collective power.

### This year, as I look forward into 2018, my dream is that this type of community can grow to a greater depth, and that more women can experience the challenge of being known, and knowing others, with the intention of impacting the world for good together.

In part, my experiences with isolation over the years are woven into the intention as we prepare to take the Yellow Collective on Tour. I know how many women are grinding through their days trying to balance their responsibilities and needs while also pursuing healthy community with kindred spirits. I know how exhausting it can be to examine our intentions and know when the desire for community comes from the best place, and I know how hard it can be to pursue.

### Yellow exists to empower creative and entrepreneurially minded women, and we dream to empower all women by giving them each other as the most precious resource.

I know that this dream will be made real as we take Yellow Co. on tour and go from city to city hosting day long pop-up conferences, where we not only learn from amazing speakers, but also get to connect women to each other as we travel the West Coast, kicking off February 17th in San Diego, CA. We will then be heading up the coast and stopping in Orange County, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle! If you are in the area, please join our tour and, more importantly, join a [community of women](https://yellowco.co/membership/) who will challenge themselves, and you, to rise to a higher standard as an agent of good in the world!
