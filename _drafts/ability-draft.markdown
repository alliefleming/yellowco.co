For every resounding doubt  
Overuse of not yet  
Handful of too late  
Enough

To the slumped shoulders  
Stifled exhales  
Tangled mess of missed attempts  
Enough

For each justification  
Guilty explanation  
Continual claim of someday   
Enough

You have outgrown   
this house you’ve been   
comfortably calling home  

The you you’re becoming  
is too big   
to live here  

Enough

Do you really believe  
you’ve hit your ceiling?

That barriers can’t be torn down  
House plants revived hundredth time over  
Arms punch skylights through the roof

Hear this

You are enough   
of the you  
you need

You are enough  
of the you  
you need

The brave you are craving?  
Enough

The wild you’re waiting on?  
Enough

That elastic bounce back?  
Enough

A romantic of possibility  
Unshakeable value  
Bare your skin shameless  
Enough

Your own steady hand to hold  
Crayon to color outside the lines  
Marble staircase crown

Hear it

You are enough  
of the you  
we need

You are enough   
of the you  
we need

Not feeling like enough has always been the big one for me. The lifelong lie that seems to sneak its way into the roots of every insecurity, fear, and doubt in my world. It has caused me to cling to others for identity, seeped anxiety into the very works I create, and placed procrastination into many of my passions. It robs me, of me.

For nearly forever, women have been told a lot on the matter of what we can’t do. The rights we didn’t deserve, intellect we weren’t capable of, strength we surely didn’t possess. So, sadly, it doesn’t surprise me that believing in our abilities is a tough one for us. But man, have we done a pretty rad job in proving the limitations placed on us wrong. And yet, most often it seems the one holding us back with a constant tug on our t-shirts, is ourselves.

How many times do we put down the pen - too afraid to commit to simply starting? How often do we sink back from speaking up - convincing ourselves into apathy of not being heard? What about the last time you didn’t ask twice for affirmation before taking action? Can you remember the last day you rested in the confidence of you?

### If owning our passions is the spark, then owning our abilities is the wind that turns it to fire.

The marriage of the two breathes life into our imagination and ignites action into our daydreams. Sometimes, this means taking the simple, staggering first step - making the cold call, hiring another to do what they’re stronger at, or even uttering your secret desire into existence. Other times, this work is the getting-dirt-under-your-fingernails kind of gritty. It can mean finally facing the false truths following you around, or making the daily, inch-by-inch crawl toward the marathon you’re in the middle of. 

### In any case, it asks our guts to shift the question from, “What are we capable of?” to, “What are we not?”

This is the month we rally. When we can clearly see ourselves in what is calling out our names so loudly. When we listen first to the tug in our stomachs toward where we are meant to go, and never to the voices that call us to stagnance. We own who we are, paying no mind to who we are not. It is the time we shake the dust, and rise to the risk of making the richest version of our days possible. For as Eleanor Roosevelt grandly challenges us (and as I imagine, with a good helping of sass), “It’s your life - but only if you make it so.”
