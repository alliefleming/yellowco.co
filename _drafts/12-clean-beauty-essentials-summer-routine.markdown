Summer has finally arrived, and with it comes lots of fun spent outside in the sun and in nature. But while it may be convenient to grab that old sunscreen on your way out the door to the beach, or a plastic water bottle on your way to a hike, we as consumers should be thinking more about what we are putting in and on our bodies during these upcoming summer months. 

Unfortunately, many of our usual summer go-to products aren’t doing much to support our health, and are loaded with harmful chemicals we do not need in or on our bodies. Luckily, there are many amazing companies that are making it so much easier for conscious consumers to shop for summer essentials that not only look out for the health of the consumer, but also the health of the planet. So with many fun summer months ahead, I rounded up my top safe, toxin-free, and sustainable summer essentials for you to use and enjoy this summer.

### Skin

###### [Natural Zinc Sunscreen](https://eirnyc.com/collections/sun-and-surf/products/surf-mud-pro), [Cooling Lip Balm](https://eirnyc.com/collections/face/products/cooling-lip-balm), & [Hydrating Face Mist](https://eirnyc.com/collections/face/products/hydrating-face-mist) by [EIR NYC](https://eirnyc.com/)

[EIR](https://eirnyc.com/) is making it simple and safe to protect your skin this summer with their incredible line of high-performance zinc sunscreens, and hydrating after-sun products. I love to use the [Surf Mud Pro sunscreen](https://eirnyc.com/collections/sun-and-surf/products/surf-mud-pro) and the [Cooling Lip Balm](https://eirnyc.com/collections/face/products/cooling-lip-balm) for long-lasting durability for any outdoor summer adventure. Once you have had enough time in the sun, try using the [Hydrating Face Mist](https://eirnyc.com/collections/face/products/hydrating-face-mist) to naturally remove your sunscreen, while also hydrating your skin with aloe and rose-infused witch hazel.

### Non-Toxic Deodorant (That Works!)

Deodorant is essential for hot summer days, but that doesn’t mean you should be exposed to harmful aluminum and other unwanted chemicals found in traditional deodorants. Below are my top three favorite clean and safe deodorants that actually work!

###### [AER Next-Level Deodorant](https://vapourbeauty.com/products/aer-next-level-deodorant) by [Vapour](https://vapourbeauty.com/)

The first deodorant in my round up is [Vapour's](https://vapourbeauty.com/) [AER Next-Level Deodorant](https://vapourbeauty.com/products/aer-next-level-deodorant) which the co-founder, and two-time breast cancer survivor, developed with a mission to create a safe deodorant that also performed! This deodorant was tested on rock climbers, skiers, yoga teachers, and triathletes, so you know it is not only safe, but also can handle any sweaty moment. 

###### [Hoppin’ Fresh Deodorant](https://www.ursamajorvt.com/products/hoppin-fresh-deodorant) by [Ursa Major](https://www.ursamajorvt.com/)

Next up is [Ursa Major's](https://www.ursamajorvt.com/) [Hoppin’ Fresh Deodorant](https://www.ursamajorvt.com/products/hoppin-fresh-deodorant), which is made in the beautiful state of Vermont and is a cooling blend of eucalyptus, ginger, rosemary, lemon, and is 100% toxin-free. This deodorant has an easy roll on application, a deliciously fresh smell, and has gained quite the cult following over the years.

###### [Activated Charcoal Deodorant Stick](https://www.piperwai.com/products/piperwai-natural-deodorant-stick) by [PiperWai](https://www.piperwai.com/) 

Lastly, [PiperWai's](https://www.piperwai.com/) [Activated Charcoal Deodorant Stick](https://www.piperwai.com/products/piperwai-natural-deodorant-stick) is another clean deodorant favorite packed with activated charcoal to help absorb moisture fast! This deodorant is void of all harmful chemicals, and uses essential oils to help kill odor-causing bacteria fast.

### Makeup

Everyone loves that perfect summer glow, but with hot days ahead it is even more important to keep makeup light and simple. These are my top three clean beauty essentials that are versatile, and just what you need for that perfect summer look. 

###### [Narcissist Foundation Stick](https://follain.com/p/w3ll-people-narcissist-foundation-stick#857900003989) by [W3LL People](https://follain.com/b/w3ll-people) 

When it comes to summer foundation, I love [W3LL People's](https://follain.com/b/w3ll-people) [Narcissist Foundation Stick](https://follain.com/p/w3ll-people-narcissist-foundation-stick#857900003989) for its versatility.

###### [“Un” Powder](https://follain.com/p/rms-beauty-un-powder) by [RMS Beauty](https://follain.com/b/rms-beauty)

For those extra sticky days, I reach for [RMS](https://follain.com/b/rms-beauty) [“Un” Powder](https://follain.com/p/rms-beauty-un-powder), which is free from parabens, talc, and perfumes. This is the perfect ultra-fine, clear setting powder that prevents excess oil from building up on hot summer days. 

###### [Lip C.P.R](https://follain.com/p/suntegrity-lip-c-p-r-spf-30#854245006545) by [Suntegrity](https://follain.com/b/suntegrity) 

Lastly, to keep your sensitive lips protected, I love [Suntegrity's](https://follain.com/b/suntegrity) [Lip C.P.R with SPF 30](https://follain.com/p/suntegrity-lip-c-p-r-spf-30#854245006545) in Sunny Blush.
