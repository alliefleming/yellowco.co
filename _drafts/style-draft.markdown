Finding your Voice in Timeless Style

Wouldn’t it be amazing if we purchased items of clothing that we could plan on passing down to our daughters one day? It was once a normalcy to purchase clothing that would last for years to come, but with today’s fast fashion, trend chasing industry, we are missing out on high quality and sustainably made items. But, the good news is, we still have the choice to pursue intentional and mindful purchases to be investments for years to come. 

With each season of life, we are continually seeking a personal, reliable style that transcends through everyday life. Whether for work, home, or play, the styles we choose provide confidence, security, encouragement, and empowerment to who we are - as mothers, business owners, teachers, creatives, lawyers, or doctors. Through our day to day - we all wear clothes and are subject to the industry of consumption and comparison as we seek our own style. We turn to trends, popular colors, and affordable brands to keep up, but we’re missing something within our wardrobes - that timeless approach to style that lasts and feels truly us. 

So let’s dive into some simple ways we can develop a style that’s timelessly you and one that stays away from fast fashion trends - as we want our pieces to be worn and loved for years to come. It starts with one piece at a time.

1. Wear what makes you feel confident
A timeless style doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a conscious effort to take note on the styles and items that you reach for when you get dressed in the morning or go out in the evening. The items that make you feel confident and comfortable as if they are an extension of your own skin and personality.

Here are a few questions that can help narrow down your style to head towards smarter and long lasting purchases...
Do you prefer comfort over trends?
Do you prefer neutrals or pops of color?
Do you prefer pants/jeans or dresses/skirts?
Do you prefer flats or heels?

2. Wear styles that fit you
It’s not only important to choose styles you like, but find the ones that fit and compliment your body will also help you achieve the wardrobe you’re seeking. This may take some trial and error or research on great brands or silhouettes for you, but this self awareness within your wardrobe will help your confidence and determination for what to wear.

And with these high quality, versatile pieces that fit, you can work to avoid growing tired of older styles and continue building pieces that can be paired with your wardrobe for years to come. That beautiful, well-made sweater. The flattering midi-dress. That pair of jeans that fits perfectly whether after a workout or a slice of cake.


3. Repeat those outfits
Don’t be afraid to repeat your favorite outfits and tops! It’s a lie in the industry that we are not supposed to rewear items that we’ve already worn before. If you have a top that you love - rewear it with no fear of anyone remembering you wore it last week. I promise from first hand experience, most people won’t remember.

And when purchasing a new items of clothing, take some time to consider if you will wear the item you’re looking to purchase more than 30 times. If not, chances are the item is not high quality enough or just not the style you really need to add to your wardrobe! 

4. Shop timeless and sustainable brands 
To get that perfect (for you) wardrobe started, you have to curate a loyal brand list to start from. There are many brands out there that are focused on bringing you timeless, well made pieces that are created ethically and sustainably with a lasting wardrobe in mind. Here are some to add to your list : 

ABLE - Clothes, shoes and accessories in seasonal styles and colors
Nisolo - Ethically made leather shoes and bags for men and women

With attention to these simple practices towards timeless style, we can take steps towards a wardrobe that has a life of wears. It may take time and intentionality, but it’s worth those steps to wear items every day that help bring confidence, comfort, sustainability and practicality to our lives.
