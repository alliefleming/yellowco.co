Ownership. I can get that for entrepreneurs. Ownership. I can get that for us as women, claiming our voices, reclaiming our time, defending our fellow humans. But this mission was two words, Our Ownership, and the way they sunk in over two days at Yellow Conference 2018 was clarifying and motivating in a way in which I’d needed a refresh.

Creative, ambitious, generous women (and some men!) filled Hudson Loft, which had been transformed into a Yellow universe, ready to learn how to work together for the good of the world.

“In this space, we’re all equals here,” Joanna began as part of her opening remarks, welcoming ~500 women into Yellow Conference’s 5th year.

This was a rallying cry to hone feminine excellence, to honor our stories and to give power to others in our service to them. This was a call to forgive whatever might be holding us back from reaching our full potential and from being ready to solve a problem or fill a need the world is hurting for.

After taking furious notes, I came away with a rubric for basically every question or scattered thought I have about what to do long-term with my “work/life blend,” as speaker Enid Hwang coined it. No one comes hoping for mediocrity in a community like this, and I was really floored by the love and respect for that throughout the conference’s two days.

As a kid, at home, I grew up without sisters, and at school, I grew apprehensive of female leadership. I didn’t bloom until in my early twenties into knowing fully what a deep well female friendship and camaraderie could be. That rich bond of support and accountability is something I had no idea I was missing out on.

Present tense, I love when my sisters say, YES, go for it. Equally, I love trusting them when they give a healthy, truthful NO.

This year’s lineup of speakers embodied the hallmark of those important yes’s and no’s.

YES. “If you feel called to do it, you should freaking do it,” championed Alison Faulkner in her talk about how to not be more awesome, but feel more awesome, or rather, as awesome as you are.

NO. “It doesn’t serve anyone when you sit around thinking you’re a big piece of poop!” She continued.

YES. “Your time belongs to you. What do you give it to?” asked Enid Hwang dropping serious, digestible rubrics for discerning priorities and goals. They’re not the same!

NO. “Put talk show on mute,” urged Nikia Phoenix, ushering us into how to nurture our self talk out of words a loved one wouldn’t give us. “Show yourself that love. Show yourself that tenderness. … Good things don’t come instantly.”

YES. You can begin with fearlessness and that’s how you create disruptive innovation, we learned from basically a grandmaster of disruption, Miki Agrawal.

NO. Systems of commerce and culture do NOT have to depend on violence as fast fashion and quick diversity checkmarks nick at the impact of resistance. Hoda Katebi broke down the power structures of fashion and advertising down for us.

YES. “Guess what, it is your time,” nodded Candice Kumai. “You have an opportunity to show people what you’re made of.”

NO. “Don’t dumb it down,” said Cassandra Lee of Justice Rising. Our passion for healing global injustice can’t rest in thinking other people’s problems are just other people’s problems, and if we start getting involved, we’ll soon find the community that makes it both possible and all worth the while, to make sure suffering doesn’t just happen on our watch.

YES. You can adapt and shape your family’s life to give and solve the world’s problems as Brittany and Ian Bentley learned to while building Parker Clay’s Ethiopian leather line. “Let’s go together,” said Ian.

“Each of us is worth it, and we need each other,” he continued, citing the African proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”

We all can Google. We know how to find too much information about how to build a dream career or how to gain influence. Even IRL, themes can easily have little more value than buzzwords.

But as these speakers rotated, I watched a kaleidoscope click to beautifully different women using their stories and passion for good, around the world and in their communities. They had proof; they had steps. At each turn, I heard in a new way how to do it for my own.

Much like the attention to detail paid to decorating and sectioning the venue, nothing was flashy. Everything was atmospheric, because of what was said and who was hearing and responding. 

With that, I say yes, please, get the Digital Pass so you don’t miss out on this year, but the real deal is being in this environment and interacting with such deeply excellent women. And shopping with them in the marketplace! That part is really fun, as were the gift bags, illustrated by Nadine Kolodziey, a 2018-2019 Adobe Creative Resident!

Knowledge and support flow freely here. Attending is an education. Here I learned about organizations and resources like Pledgeling and InLieu that are widening accessibility for giving back to causes on the corporate and individual levels.

For every speaker, marketplace vendor and even every gift bag item, there was tangible proof that it’s possible to use business for good in so many ways.

Toxin and cruelty-free beauty abounded in Cocos Organics lip balm, Elate Cosmetics eyeshadow, Ursa Major deodorant, Trilogy rosehip oil and all Saje everything for the Yellow lounges.

Makers for Imani Collective and Tumble are not only sewing and soldering beautiful goods, but fashioning new lives for themselves and their communities.

In her talk, Allison Fallon convinced us that we’re all writers and need to write the truth, regularly. Well, there’s no dodging that now that we’re equipped with fair-trade notebooks by Raven & Lily, a B-Corp, and Ooly Pens that give back to classrooms, and market bags from Eco-Bags, another B-Corp, to take them around on errands.

To close such a beautiful cast of speakers, Ameena Brown’s spoken word made us both laugh and remember soberly, confidently, “We are not alone doing the work we do.”

As I filled nearly a whole pocket notebook with scribbled wisdom, I came away from each practical and inspiring talk with a fresh zing of, “Yeah? Well, my sister said…” for any opposition, external or internal. I’m thinking about that five-year-old Cardi B meme...

“There is a big difference between someone who wants to do something and someone who wants to be a ‘SOMEONE.’ I suggest you DO something,” Candice had said.

Unique to women is how inextricable our passion is from everything we do! It’s confidence in “intuition,” as Hail Merry founder Susan O’Brien pointed out. We can tap into a new and better future by putting your dreams to work now.

What better time is there to own it?
