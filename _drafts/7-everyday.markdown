One of my favorite sayings in life is, “actions speak louder than words.”  It’s a theme I try to live out daily. I’m far from perfect and fail at it often. They say our actions reveal who we really are; whether it be holding the door for the person behind you, or learning the name of your restaurant server. Every choice reveals more about our true character.

My mother taught my sister and I that we vote with our dollar. It drove me crazy growing up, but now it’s something I take quite seriously. What are my actions revealing about my character based on the way I vote with my dollar?

Her lesson has instilled in me a desire to support brands (and people) that show respect to where it came from and the people who made it. Plus, I love being able to tell the story behind things I love, especially when they’re made by people who are working to have a positive impact on the world. So, if you’re anything like me, and want to support people out there everyday letting their actions speak for them in the things they make, I’ve compiled a list of some of my favorites.

##### [Lauren B Nail Polish](https://www.laurenbbeauty.com/)

Manicures and pedicures are one of my favorite indulgences. There’s something about freshly manicured nails that makes me feel put together. I’m obsessed with Lauren B polishes. Not only because of the great colors and options, but they are made in the USA, vegan, and free of harsh chemicals, including formaldehyde, DBP, toluene, formaldehyde resin, and camphor. Current color crush – Departing LAX.

##### [Insulated Stainless Steel Water Bottle by Cheeky](https://www.cheekyhome.com/products/cheeky-go-millennial-pink-20oz-water-bottle)

One of my new year’s resolutions is to drink more water. Original, I know. One of my tricks to make sure I drink enough is to carry a large water bottle with me. Because it’s heavy, I’ll drink it quickly to lighten the load. This trick never fails in getting me past my daily goal. Cheeky’s water bottle has become a staple in my life because it not only meets my sizing needs, it's fully insulated so water stays cold. Plus, for every bottle purchased, they donate a meal to Feeding America.

##### [Atmosphere Protection Cream by Osea Malibu](https://oseamalibu.com/collections/shop/products/atmosphere-protection-cream)

I was first introduced to the Atmosphere Protection Cream by Osea Malibu in a subscription box – it was love at first try. All of their products are vegan and include seaweed, as it’s one of the most abundant sources of vitamins, minerals, amino acids, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. They are also free of synthetic chemicals, including parabens, petrochemicals, and sulfates. Not to mention, everything comes in glass bottles to reduce waste and the harmful chemicals found in plastic.

##### [The Long Play by Keep Cup](http://us.keepcup.com/keepcup-series/longplay-series/longplay-cino.html)

If you are to buy just one cup of coffee or tea in a disposable cup every day, you’ll end up creating about 23 pounds of waste in one year. Pretty staggering, huh? I decided to take the challenge to reduce my carbon footprint and discovered Keep Cup, which has become a chic staple in my life. Because reducing our carbon footprint is a priority to the founders, they collaborate with warehouses to use local vendors for assembly, packaging, and point of sale materials to further reduce their environmental impact.

##### [Earbuds By LSTN](https://lstnsound.co/collections/earbuds/products/bamboo-avalon-earbuds)

Full confession: I am a podcast junkie. Luckily, I live in Los Angeles, so I have plenty of time to indulge my addiction while stuck in our infamous traffic. And you’ll rarely find me without my LSTN earbuds in my ears or hanging around my neck. Not only do they provide excellent sound quality, but proceeds from sales of all products go towards giving hearing aids to people in need worldwide via their charity partner, Starkey Hearing Foundation. They also strive to use sustainable and sustainably sourced materials whenever possible.

##### [Pansy Co.](http://www.pansy.co/)

Underwear is such a basic part of our lives that we often forget to think about how it is made or who makes it. I’ve recently been introduced to Pansy Co. and love that not only is their organic cotton grown domestically and designed and sewn locally in California, but the designs are fun and flattering. My favorite part?  Once they are no longer wearable, everything can be thrown in the compost pile to once again return to the earth.

##### [Studio Skin Legging by Outdoor Voices](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/studio-skin-legging?variant=19637567685)

I’m one of those annoying people who actually like to run. However, I struggle with the fact that work-out gear is often made from toxic products and contain carcinogens. Kind of ironic to wear something toxic while you’re doing something to take care of yourself, right? So when I learned about Outdoor Voices, I was thrilled. Not only do they work to ensure their fabrics are sustainable, their seamless collection is designed in a way that eliminates the need to cut and sew the pieces, reducing waste thanks to no left over scraps. What I really love though is that they ensure all employees are safe, paid fairly, with benefits, and regulated work hours.
