Our sense of true belonging allows all that you are to be enough - for others, for yourself. It has the great ability to flourish us into the greatest versions of ourselves. Inviting others into our lives does so much more than keep us from loneliness; the people in our lives change us. They teach us new ways to see the world; they balance our weaknesses and inspire growth; they can be the muses that allow our imaginations to run wild with new dreams.

Our focus for August is **[Belong](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/07/30/how-uniting-blooms-belong-poem/)**. This month, we will explore the many ways we desire to belong as humans, and how we can find them. Weâ€™ll recognize how in this shared search to be part of a larger whole, not only are we are all in this thing together, but we are a much richer palette as one than we ever could be on our own.
