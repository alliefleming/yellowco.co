Our sense of true belonging allows all that you are to be enough - for others, for yourself. It has the great ability to flourish us into the greatest versions of ourselves, or in the lack of it, to crumble us. Our focus for August is **[Belong](yellowco.co/blog/2018/07/30/how-uniting-blooms-belong-poem/)**. This month, we will explore the many ways we desire to belong as humans, and how we can find them. Weâ€™ll recognize how in this shared search to be part of a larger whole, not only are we are all in this thing together, but we are a much richer palette as one than we ever could be on our own.
