Our focus for this April is **Privilege**. Throughout the month, we'll be opening up conversation around this topic for the very reason that it is often avoided. By its nature, privilege touches us all differently. Join us to lean in and listen to the experiences of others. Reflect inward to see the privilege you have as a responsibility. Discover how you can utilize what you have creatively to better this world, and be inspired by those before you to continue progressing equality.
