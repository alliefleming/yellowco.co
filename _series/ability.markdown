How many times do we put down the pen - too afraid to commit to simply starting? How often do we sink back from speaking up - convincing ourselves into apathy of not being heard? Can you remember the last day you rested in the confidence of you?
If owning our passions is the spark, then owning our abilities is the wind that turns it to fire.

Our focus for July is **[Ability](https://yellowco.co/blog/2018/07/02/you-are-enough-poem-recognize-ability/)**. This month, we will be empowering women to own their abilities, recognize their potential to learn new skills, and see how capable they are of making an impact on the world with their individual strengths. It is the time we shake the dust, and rise to the risk of making the richest version of our days possible.
