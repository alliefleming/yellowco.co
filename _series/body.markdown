Our focus this June is **[Body](yellowco.co/blog/2018/06/04/you-are-essential-create-body-positive-culture/)**. This month, we're reflecting on how we can take ownership over, respect, and love our bodies. We will rediscover the wonder and hold gratitude for all the incredible ways they not just function, but are intricately tied to the essence of who we are; how we speak, move, and connect with others. We are all craving a culture of body positive women, and a world with a non-singular standard of beauty. Let's join the collective effort to create it.
