Our focus for this May is **[Voice](yellowco.co/blog/2018/04/30/sharing-your-individual-voice-necessary-meditation/)**. During the month, we'll be uncovering our individuality, and discovering how we can use our voices to impact others for good. _Your_ specific expression of thrill, loss, joy, fear, and love can speak loudly to the core of others. And truly, there are few things more gratifying, more soul swelling, than finding something for our fingers to grab onto that defines our human experience. So, can you bravely choose to join us in being curious enough about what could happen when you not just embrace, but articulate your distinct character?
