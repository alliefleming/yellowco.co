details:
- title: crave direction and purpose?
  text: You’re struggling to find the larger purpose in what you do. You move from
    client to client or project to project with no direction or clarity on how to
    make the impact you desire.
- title: know you're capable of more?
  text: You know you have potential that’s waiting to be unleashed. You know that
    you’re capable of making big waves of good in the world, but you don’t know where
    or how to start.
- title: search to find your "people"?
  text: You move from network to network but never feel like you’ve found your place.
    You crave a genuine group of women who care about building more than just a career.
faqs:
- question: Do you ship internationally?
  answer: We offer free shipping within the US., but international shipping prices
    vary depending on your location. Feel free to chat us below for more info!
- question: Can I cancel my membership?
  answer: "Our membership is month to month and you can cancel anytime, although we’d
    be sad to see you go \U0001F642"
- question: What comes with membership?
  answer: Membership value is delivered in 3 ways. Physically, with a monthly packet
    mailed to your door. Digitally, with access to our online hub of tools, resources
    and digital chats and webcasts. Lastly, in-person. We host monthly in-person gatherings
    with our chapters across the US. If you’re not in a location with an in-person
    chapter, we have digital chapters that meet on Zoom once a month!
- question: How much is shipping?
  answer: It’s free if you’re within the US! If you’re international, shipping prices
    vary depending on your location.
- question: Where are your chapters and how do the gatherings work?
  answer: Currently we have chapters in West LA, Downtown LA, The Valley LA, Orange
    County, San Diego, Bay Area, New York City, Cincinnati, Austin, Chicago, Denver
    and Tulsa. The gatherings are centered around our focus for the month, but each
    chapter throws in their own flare! The goal is for you to receive your periodical,
    go through the content and the questions, then come together with your group and
    talk through the focus for the that month and what you thought of the periodical.
    Every gathering ends with a 'helping circle' where each woman has an ask, and
    each woman commits to helping that person for that month. We always leave feeling
    inspired, having things to think about and having new goals to implement into
    our lives. They’re pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves.
