- title: CRAVE DIRECTION & PURPOSE?
  text: You’re struggling to find the larger purpose in what you do. You move from
    client to client or project to project with no direction or clarity on how to
    make the impact you desire.
- title: KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MORE?
  text: You know you have potential that’s waiting to be unleashed. You know that
    you’re capable of making big waves of good in the world, but you don’t know where
    or how to start.
- title: SEARCHING TO FIND YOUR "PEOPLE"?
  text: You move from network to network but never feel like you’ve found your place.
    You crave a genuine group of women who care about building more than just a career.

  title: 'Take 2018 by storm with our 2018 theme: Our Ownership'
  text: |-
    What does it look like for us as women who are working towards advancing good in the world to OWN who we are, our stories and the issues we see happening all around us?

    What does it look like when we STOP longing for what we don't have, and start owning what we DO have in front of us? What if we stopped denying our passion, our art, and started acknowledging it and giving it room in our lives?

    What if we stopped the comparison game, stopped worrying about who is better and started to OWN who we are as unique, individual women working to make the world a better place? What if we took ownership, together, of the issues our world is facing and come together to make a change?

    This isn't just my ownership, or yours. It's OURS.

    Join us each month throughout 2018 as we dive into a different focus of ownership, all empowering you to take ownership of your life, who you were meant to be and your personal impact on the world.
faqs:
- question: Do you ship internationally?
  answer: We offer free shipping within the US., but international shipping prices
    vary depending on your location. Feel free to chat us below for more info!
- question: Can I cancel my membership?
  answer: "Our membership is month to month and you can cancel anytime, although we’d
    be sad to see you go \U0001F642"
- question: What comes with membership?
  answer: Membership value is delivered in 3 ways. Physically, with a monthly packet
    mailed to your door. Digitally, with access to our online hub of tools, resources
    and digital chats and webcasts. Lastly, in-person. We host monthly in-person gatherings
    with our chapters across the US. If you’re not in a location with an in-person
    chapter, we have digital chapters that meet on Zoom once a month!
- question: How much is shipping?
  answer: It’s free if you’re within the US! If you’re international, shipping prices
    vary depending on your location.
- question: Where are your chapters and how do the gatherings work?
  answer: Currently we have chapters in West LA, Downtown LA, The Valley LA, Orange
    County, San Diego, Bay Area, New York City, Cincinnati, Austin, Chicago, Denver
    and Tulsa. The gatherings are centered around our focus for the month, but each
    chapter throws in their own flare! The goal is for you to receive your periodical,
    go through the content and the questions, then come together with your group and
    talk through the focus for the that month and what you thought of the periodical.
    Every gathering ends with a 'helping circle' where each woman has an ask, and
    each woman commits to helping that person for that month. We always leave feeling
    inspired, having things to think about and having new goals to implement into
    our lives. They’re pretty awesome if we do say so ourselves.
- question: Where can I find more information?
