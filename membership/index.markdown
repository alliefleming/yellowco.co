- title: CRAVE DIRECTION & PURPOSE?
  text: You’re struggling to find the larger purpose in what you do. You move from
    client to client or project to project with no direction or clarity on how to
    make the impact you desire.
- title: KNOW YOU'RE CAPABLE OF MORE?
  text: You know you have potential that’s waiting to be unleashed. You know that
    you’re capable of making big waves of good in the world, but you don’t know where
    or how to start.
- title: SEARCHING TO FIND YOUR "PEOPLE"?
  text: You move from network to network but never feel like you’ve found your place.
    You crave a genuine group of women who care about building more than just a career.

  title: 'Take 2018 by storm with our 2018 theme: Our Ownership'
  text: |-
    What does it look like for us as women who are working toward advancing good in the world to _OWN_ who we are, our stories and the issues we see happening all around us? What does it look like when we _STOP_ longing for what we don't have, and start owning what we DO have? What if we stopped denying our passion, our art, and started acknowledging it, giving it room in our lives?

    What if we stopped the comparison game and started to OWN who we are as unique, individual women? What if we took ownership of the issues our world is facing and come together to make a change?

    This isn't just my ownership, or yours. It's _OURS._

    **Join us each month throughout 2018 as we dive into a different focus of ownership, all empowering you to take ownership of your life, who you were meant to be and your personal impact on the world.**

faqs:
- question: Where can I find more information?
  answer: "You can hop on our email list! \U0001F449 [Yellow Membership Interest List](http://eepurl.com/bEZbaH)"
- question: What comes with membership?
  answer: Membership value is delivered in 3 ways. Physically, with a monthly packet
    mailed to your door. Digitally, with access to our online hub of tools, resources
    and digital chats and webcasts. Lastly, in-person. We host monthly in-person gatherings
    with our chapters across the US. If you’re not in a location with an in-person
    chapter, we have digital chapters that meet on Zoom once a month!
- question: Where are your chapters and how do the gatherings work?
  answer: Currently we have chapters in West LA, Downtown LA, Orange County, San Diego,
    Bay Area, New York City, Cincinnati, Austin, Chicago, Denver and Tulsa. The gatherings
    are centered around our focus for the month, but each chapter throws in their
    own flare! The goal is for you to receive your periodical, go through the content
    and the questions, then come together with your group and talk through the focus
    for the that month and what you thought of the periodical. Every gathering ends
    with a 'helping circle' where each woman has an ask, and each woman commits to
    helping that person for that month. We always leave feeling inspired, having things
    to think about and having new goals to implement into our lives. They’re pretty
    awesome if we do say so ourselves.
- question: How much is shipping?
  answer: If you're in the US, We offer free shipping, but international shipping
    prices vary depending on your location. Feel free to chat us below for more info!
